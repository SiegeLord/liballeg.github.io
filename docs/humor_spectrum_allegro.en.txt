              Or just keep using Allegro 4.x if you insist on DOS support.        
                                                                                  
              I think (not sure) the DOS port is being dropped from 5.0 because   
              the new rewrite has features DOS doesn't support easily, or at all. 
              Someone else can come up with a list, but I believe it includes     
23yrold3yrold things like dual-monitor support. So you really can't port it.      
Member# 1,134 That's, y'know, why it's being dropped

              Stick with 4.x.

              That's what lwithers said the last time this came up. If it's not   
              being dropped, then where on Earth are people getting this from?

              Yes, Chris. I'm sure that Allegro is being ported to 20-yer-old     
Goodbytes     computers. While we're at it, why don't we do a UNIVAC port too?

              Not for all the tea in China! Well, I might for all the tea in      
  Goodbytes   China, or the rice--no, that's ridiculous--the preserved ginger     
              then--no, let's say half the tea, the ginger, a shipment of         
              shark-fin soup double-discounted just to take it off your hands...

              If you have a UNIVAC, I'd like to see you not go insane while

Member# 630   Sorry, I never said the DOS support would be dropped. In fact I     
September     made it explicitly clear that I was *not* saying whether there      
2000          would or would not be DOS support. Please read more carefully.

Daniel        Wow! C64 had a 256K ram upgrade? Was there any games that took      
Schlyder      advantage of it? I still remember the disk drive I bought. Best     
Member# 257   hardware upgrade ever!!! :-) No more half-hours waiting for         
April 2000    Gauntlet to crash just before it finished loading. :-)              
                                                                                  
   Daniel     This new mailing list got me thinking. If it can be set up so       
  Schlyder    easily, why isn't the Allegro conductors list moved to Sourceforge  
              so it can be archived? Would be nice...

              Yeah... C64 support - that's GOOD - YOU KNOW -                      
              this is in fact the best 8bit computer on the GLOBE! I'm not        
              kidding !!!                                                         
                                                                                  
              but why you are going to remove DOS support in the future ? as YOU  
Rafal Szyja   said - DOS port is the most stable ONE!

              Amazing basic style commands and a wide range of features. It's now

              Check out the included examples on tapes 33-38 of the 63 tape set   
              by some famous allegro coders:                                      
                                                                                  
              * Johan Peitz contributed a port of his icy tower to the Spectrum.  
              Featuring highly detailed 2 colour graphics and a special theme     
              song in 3 warbly chip sound channels based on the original ingame   
              music. How high can you flip the screen up the tower?               
                                                                                  
              * Richard Phipps contributed SpeccyPaint, a 2 colour masterpiece of 
              a paint program. Featuring an internal buffer of 1 bit graphics     
              shown on an entirely different 1 bit buffer. Amazing contrast       
              control, choose from black and white with a full 1 bit range.       
              Richard also contributed to the core routines with some important   
              hacks, patches and bug fixes to get around his original bugs and    
              mistakes.                                                           
                                                                                  
Richard       * Bob contributed his powerful SBlend routines. Amazing alpha blend 
Phipps        effects in full 1 bit colour. All at incredibly fast speeds for a   
Member# 1,632 1MHZ machine. Frame rate for full screen blends is now approaching

   Richard    * Thomas Fjellstrom created the special linux speccy setup,         
   Phipps     CrashHat. (Warning, most versions will require a special tape       
              player capable of playing tapes bigger than 128k).                  
                                                                                  
              * 23yrdold3yrold created the demo game. A flip screen Monty Mole on 
              the run platform game with special curved platforms. Chris is also  
              the author of the Spectrum demo A Brief History of Spam. Featuring  
              the worlds longest ever spamming scrolltext. Weighing in at a       
              massive 96 hours due to very clever compression and random          
              repeating sections.                                                 
                                                                                  
              * Thomas Harte contributed to the special DirectS overlay           
              functions, enabling the spectrum version of Allegro to work on      
              normal TV's!                                                        
                                                                                  
              * Shawn Hargreaves wrote most of the core routines in specially     
              optimised Z80 machine code. He was helpfully assisted by            
              Spellcaster and Thomas Harte for the final core library, after they 
              decided to rewrite 5 earlier versions of the core routines due to   
              'internal disagreements' of a DirectS nature.                       
                                                                                  
              * Matt Smith generously provided the fast and creative sprite       
              routines. As well as the palette control routines. See Example 5,   
              "Scrolling Dot Rope" for a special routine created by Matt.

              This is why I wonder when people say things like "The DOS port is

                Yes, Chris. I'm sure that Allegro is being ported to 20-yer-old   
23yrold3yrold   computers.

              If someone who loves the Spectrum 128K or something and can do it,  
              I wouldn't doubt it. Hell, Shawn ported Allegro to the X-Box just   
              for fun. That's h4rdc0r3!!                                          
                                                                                  
              Mind you, I have no clue what a Spectrum 128K is (hardware idiot,   
              remember?) Is this the first wave of Palladium systems?

              Alot of the code will not be rewritten, like the drivers for        
   Thomas     hardware etc... The reason for the new API is so that features can

November 2001 It was out before the C64 and the atari/apple computers. It had 2   
              colour graphics, but each 8 x 8 character block could have it's own

              I think you undersell the Spectrum a bit. Remember also that it had 
              a CPU that was substantially faster (not just in cycle terms, in    
              terms of what you could calculate in the real world) and more       
              flexible than that of the Atari/Apple. This, coupled with the fact  
              that it had a genuine frame buffer made it much nicer for most      
              types of graphics above the simple sprite/background sort - see the 
Thomas Harte  way that isometric games were pioneered on the Spectrum, and some   
Member# 33    popular 3d titles such as Virus have their only 8bit incarnation on 
April 2000    the Spectrum. Even if the Spectrum version is rubbish!

              match anything I could do on a 486 PC, including voxel landscapes,  
              fast filled polygon worlds with environment mapping, and so on.     
                                                                                  
              If you really want to make things unbearable for yourself, you can  
              see it all via my Allegro powered Spectrum emulator, long dead and  
              never allegro.cc listed, but kept for no apparent reason at

              YES! Gba support is more of a must, there already exists a free gcc 
    Yves      compiler for GBA. I tried coding for the GBA, but i quickly got     
Manuelpillai  annoyed because doing some basic stuff like clearing the screen,    
              displaying and loading images were a pain in the a$$. All in all i  
              ended up quitting GBA coding, so we _SHOULD_ make a GBA port.       
              Ppl (not just the underground 8 bit coders) would acctually be      
              interested in coding for it.

              Don't you need some sort of hardware for GBA coding though? Flash   
              cards or somethng? I would still prefer the DC. Nothing would bring 
              me greater joy than playing a creation of mine on a big-screen TV   
              8) Plus it's just got more oomph; anything I can code for GBA I can 
              code for my PC. The DC on the other hand can do some very nice      
23yrold3yrold graphics; that alone makes me salivate.

March 2001    Of course, I understand the user base for GBA is probably bigger    
              than DC. How about PS2 then? ;)

              No, you can program for the GBA using just one lead, thanks to the  
              hardware GBA feature intended to allow link up games with only one  
Thomas Harte  cartridge.

April 2000    I would get into it if I could afford a GBA and trusted my money to 
              the cable suppliers.

              Also, we'll already have an instant PS2 port once an SDL driver for 
              Allegro is written. I hope to write one for Allegro 5 if no-one     
              else will.

              You don't even need a lead to program games for the GBA, just       
Eskimo Ninja  compile them into the GBA ROM format, and use an emulator (I use    
Member# 1,256 Boycott Advance) to run them...
