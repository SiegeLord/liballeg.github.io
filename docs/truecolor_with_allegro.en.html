1998 comment: I wrote this back when Allegro 3.0 was just going into beta, 
for the benefit of people who were used to the old 256 color functions and 
just wanted to know what was different about the new truecolor modes. If the 
wording sometimes seems a little strange, that is why: it was written to 
explain some new features to experienced users, rather than as a tutorial 
for beginners. But it can probably serve in either role, which is why I've 
left it up here.

Well, here it is. Lots of new graphics code, millions of additional colors, 
and the end to those pesky eight bit paletted images. There aren't actually 
very many new functions, though: it is more a matter of the old routines 
working in slightly different ways. Details can of course be found in the 
main library documentation, but I thought this guide might be useful as a 
quick-start for people who are already familar with the 256 color API, and 
simply need to know what is different in a truecolor mode. So, how do you go 
about using a truecolor resolution?
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Short answer:</b>
<p>
Call set_color_depth() before set_gfx_mode().
<p>

<p>
<b>Medium answer:</b>
<p>
Call set_color_depth() at the start of your program (before set_gfx_mode(), 
and before you read in any bitmap data from the disk).
<p>
Use the makecol() function (or makecol15(), makecol16(), etc, if you know 
for certain what color depth you will be using), to convert color values 
from red, green, and blue intensities into the format being used by the 
video hardware, and then pass the resulting integer color to any of the 
drawing functions.
<p>
Use magenta (maximum red and blue, zero green) instead of zero as a marker 
for masked pixels.

<b>Long answer:</b>
<p>
As well as the standard 8 bit paletted mode, Allegro now supports 15 and 16 
bit hicolor and 24 and 32 bit truecolor resolutions. In the 15 bit modes, 
there is 5 bits each of red, green, and blue, and one unused bit to pad out 
the size of each pixel. In a 16 bit mode there are 5 bits of red and blue 
and 6 bits of green. In 24 bit modes each pixel is three bytes, one each of 
red, green, and blue (this tends to slow things down quite a bit due to bad 
data alignments!), and 32 bit modes are the same as 24 bit ones but with an 
extra spare byte per pixel to keep things nicely aligned.
<p>
Which modes you can use will depend on your graphics card and VESA driver. 
Most cards support both 15 and 16 bit resolutions, but if at all possible 
I would advise you to support both (it's not hard...) in case one is not 
available. Some cards support both 24 and 32 bit truecolor, in which case it 
is a choice between 24 (saves memory) or 32 (faster), but many older cards 
don't have any 32 bit mode and many newer ones don't support 24 bits. As to 
what screen sizes you can use, most cards will support all the standard SVGA 
resolutions, and with UniVBE you may also get some lowres truecolor modes 
like 320x200, 320x240, etc. On a card with one meg of video RAM you will be 
able to use 640x480 hicolor modes, and also 800x600 if you have a linear 
framebuffer. With two meg of video RAM you will be able to use 640x480 
hicolor with two pages, 800x600 hicolor (two pages if you have a linear 
framebuffer), and 1024x768 hicolor, plus 640x480 truecolor (also 800x600 
truecolor if you have a linear framebuffer). With four meg of video RAM just 
about anything is possible :-)
<p>
Allegro maintains a global color depth setting, which can be changed by 
calling set_color_depth(newdepth). This does nothing in itself, but it 
affects all subsequent calls to set_gfx_mode(), create_bitmap(), and any of 
the bitmap or datafile loading commands, so typically you will use it once 
at the start of your program to specify which color depth you would like to 
work in.
<p>
All truecolor pixel values are passed to the drawing functions as regular 
ints, just as in eight bit modes. How the individual color bits are layed 
out within these pixels can vary depending on the resolution, though, so you 
should avoid hardcoding any bit patterns into your program (other than zero 
as black and all ones as white). Instead, use the makecol() function to pack 
red, green, and blue values (range 0-255) into the correct format for the 
current color depth, or the faster versions makecol15(), makecol16(), etc, 
if you know for sure what color depth you are using. Use getr(), getg(), and 
getb(), or the faster getr15(), getr16(), etc, to extract the individual 
color components from a pixel value. All of these functions depend on 
knowing how the color bits are layed out (RGB or BGR format), which isn't 
detected until after you call set_gfx_mode(), so you should always select 
the video mode before using these routines.
<p>
Bitmap objects can be read in from datafiles (any color depth), .PCX files 
(8 or 24 bit color), .BMP files (8 or 24 bit color), .LBM files (8 bit 
color), and TGA files (8, 15, or 24 bit color). By default the data will be 
converted into the current color depth format, but you can request it to be 
left in the original form by calling the set_color_conversion() function. 
The image loader routines need to know what pixel format your display 
hardware is using, so you must set the video mode before reading in any 
graphics (if you load the images while still in text mode, your program will 
be prone to obscure bugs with colors being displayed wrongly on certain 
graphics cards). If you use any compiled datafiles containing truecolor 
graphics, you should call the function fixup_datafile() after you set the 
screen mode, to make sure the data is in the correct format.
<p>
For marking transparent pixels in sprites, zero cannot be used in truecolor 
modes, because unlike a 256 color paletted image it is required for storing 
black pixels. Instead, Allegro uses bright pink (maximum red and blue, zero 
green). You can obtain this value by calling makecol(0xFF, 0, 0xFF), or 
using the constants for specific color depths, MASK_COLOR_8, MASK_COLOR_15, 
MASK_COLOR_16, etc, or if you want to know the transparent color for a 
specific bitmap, use bitmap_mask_color(bmp).
<p>
In general, Allegro is designed to be used in only one color depth at a 
time, so you will call set_color_depth() once and then store all your 
bitmaps in the same format. If you want to mix several different pixel 
formats, you can use create_bitmap_ex() in place of create_bitmap(), and 
call bitmap_color_depth() to query the format of a specific image. Most of 
the graphics routines require all their input parameters to be in the same 
format (eg. you cannot stretch a 15 bit source bitmap onto a 24 bit 
destination), but there are three exceptions: blit() can copy between 
bitmaps of any format, converting the data as required, draw_sprite() can 
draw 256 color source images onto destinations of any format, and 
draw_character() _always_ uses a 256 color source bitmap, whatever the 
format of the destination. Expanding a 256 color source onto a truecolor 
destination is fairly fast (obviously you must set the correct palette 
before doing this conversion!). Converting between different truecolor 
formats is slightly slower, and reducing truecolor images to a 256 color 
destination is very slow (it can be sped up significantly if you set up the 
global rgb_map table before doing the conversion).
<p>
There are no hardware palettes in truecolor modes, so the palette fading 
functions no longer work. You can still call set_palette(), though, to 
specifiy what palette should be used when converting bitmaps between 256 and 
truecolor formats. There is a global array called palette_color[] which 
lists the values of every entry in the palette, in the correct format for 
the current video mode. So if you are in a truecolor mode and want to draw a 
line using color #3 from the current palette, pass palette_color[3] as the 
color parameter to the line() function.
<p>
Translucency works totally differently in truecolor modes: the color_map 
table is no longer used. Instead, you must call set_blender_mode() or 
set_trans_blender() before drawing any lit or translucent objects.
<p>
If you want to access the contents of a truecolor bitmap directly, you can 
use the bmp-&gt;line[] table or the bmp_write_line() function just as you would
in a 256 color mode. In a 15 or 16 bit mode you must cast the line pointer 
to an (unsigned short *) before you dereference it, or use the _farpokew() 
function, and in 32 bit modes you must cast the pointer to an (unsigned long 
*) or use _farpokel(). In 24 bit modes a pixel consists of three bytes, 
which makes accessing it rather more of a pain: you could use three 
consecutive writes into the 8 bit line data, or cast and use one write to a 
short and another to the single extra byte.
<p>
The _putpixel() and _getpixel() inline functions only work in 256 color 
modes, and the 3d polygon drawing routines are also unsupported in truecolor 
resolutions. All the other graphics functions will work in any mode.
<p>
If you want to use the GUI routines in a truecolor mode, you must set the 
global variables gui_fg_color, gui_mg_color, and gui_bg_color to sensible 
values (as returned by the makecol() function, typically black, grey, and 
white respectively).
