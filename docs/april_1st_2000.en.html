It's true!!  It's true!  Little green men have appeared at my town,
and they told me to buy Microsoft Windows 2000.  We are now their
slaves, and I am no longer allowed to use Linux, because of its
poor stability and all of its commercial coorporate techniques it
uses to get us to use it (I don't think I'll ever get over Tux's
brainwashing)!
<p>
This is a warning before they come to your town.  Use Windows 2000!
It's stable, perfect for gaming, and can make you a lot of money!
Linux is a hoax.  Also, I have decided to give up my career as a
programmer, and take up farming, because Shawn himself told me that
Allegro has been stopped, because DirectX will do everything for us,
and there's no reason to support anything else!!
<p>
Since Shawn has quit altogether, I suggest you all go work for
Microsoft, because they rule!  This mailing list will self-destruct
in 30 seconds...  By the way, this has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do
with it being April 1, 2000.  Don't let them fool you!  Worship Bill!
