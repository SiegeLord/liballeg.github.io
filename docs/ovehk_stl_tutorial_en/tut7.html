<H1>Chapter 7</H1>
<H2>7. Action</H2>
If you downloaded the tutorial data file before Section 2 of this chapter
was written (Feb 28), please <A HREF="../ovehk_stl_tutorial.zip">redownload</A> it (don't
forget to regenerate <CODE>tutorial.h</CODE>), because three sound effects
have been added to it to support Section 2. There will also be another update
to support Section 3 soon.
<H3>7.1 Explosions</H3>
There are few action games without any explosions, and we don't really want
to be worse, we want A LOT of explosions. We can't have any of that fully
armed bombs falling into the ground and magically vanishing without an
explosion, can we? Now, an explosion effect is an independent effect that
can be triggered by a bomb, but then exists independent of it. Thus, we
need to write an explosion class, and launch one whenever the bomb hits
the ground.
<P>
Since the code is getting large, I will not show it in its entirety
unnecessarily. So, at the top, add
<PRE>
#define BOOM_DELAY 5
</PRE>
and add this class before the <CODE>projectile</CODE> class
<PRE>
class explosion : public sprite {
 int frame,delay,magnitude;
public:
 explosion(fix _X,fix _Y,int mag)
  : sprite(_X,_Y,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_BOOM1].dat) {
  magnitude=mag; frame=0; delay=0;
 }
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {
  draw_rle_sprite(dest,image,X-image-&gt;w/2,Y-image-&gt;h/2);
 }
 virtual bool animate() {
  if ((delay++)&gt;BOOM_DELAY) {
   if ((frame++)&gt;magnitude) return TRUE;
   image=(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_BOOM1+frame].dat;
   delay=0;
  }
  return FALSE;
 }
};
</PRE>
Here, the <CODE>magnitude</CODE> field tells how many frames of the
explosions should be shown, and the <CODE>draw()</CODE> method is
overridden to show the explosion with X,Y representing the center
position instead of the top-left position of the sprites, mostly because
our explosion sprites have different sizes but they are all centered.
<P>
To make it easy for the code to choose which graphics to show, we have
ordered the sprites (in the data file) by numbering each <CODE>BOOM</CODE>
sprite, thus making it easy to choose the correct image by just adding the
frame number we want to <CODE>BOOM1</CODE>, and showing that. Since the
Grabber automatically sorts the data file, this is very handy for animations
where several frames has to be shown in sequence.
<P>
Now, we need an explosion to be activated when a bomb hits the ground,
so we will need to change the <CODE>projectile</CODE> class to:
<PRE>
class projectile : public sprite {
 fix DX,DY;
 int force;
public:
 projectile(fix _X,fix _Y,fix _DX,fix _DY,RLE_SPRITE*img,int power)
  : sprite(_X,_Y,img) { DX=_DX; DY=_DY; force=power; }
 virtual bool animate() {
  move(DX,DY); DY+=GRAVITY;
  if (Y+image-&gt;h&gt;=MAX_Y) {
   sprites.push_back(new explosion(X+image-&gt;w/2,Y+image-&gt;h,force/2));
   return TRUE;
  } else return FALSE;
 }
};
</PRE>
When a bomb hits the ground now, it will spawn an explosion with a magnitude
that is one half of the assigned explosive power (which we set to 5 for a
bomb, so the magnitude will be 2).
<H3>7.2 Sound Effects</H3>
With Allegro, this is trivial. First, we must install sound support. After
<CODE>install_keyboard();</CODE> (or wherever) in <CODE>main()</CODE>, insert
<PRE>
 install_sound(DIGI_AUTODETECT,MIDI_NONE,NULL);
</PRE>
to install the Allegro Sound System. Now, we will trigger a neat explosion
sound whenever an explosion is set off. Change the <CODE>explosion</CODE>
constructor to read:
<PRE>
 explosion(fix _X,fix _Y,int mag)
  : sprite(_X,_Y,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_BOOM1].dat) {
  magnitude=mag; frame=0; delay=0;
  stop_sample((SAMPLE*)data[TUT_BANG0].dat);
  play_sample((SAMPLE*)data[TUT_BANG0].dat,255,(256*(int)X)/SCREEN_W,1000,FALSE);
 }
</PRE>
Here, we stop any previously playing explosion sounds (otherwise the result
might get *very* loud and distorted, especially considering the quantity of
bombs we are able to pour out), then start a new one. The loudness is here
255 (max), the pan (0-255) is set according to the X position of the
explosion for those lucky enough to have a stereo sound card, and the
frequency is normalized (1000), and it should not loop. (The <CODE>int</CODE>
typecast in the pan calculation is for avoiding a fixed-point overflow.)
<P>
For fun, you may try the other two sound effects I put in the datafile,
<CODE>TUT_BANG1</CODE> and <CODE>TUT_BANG2</CODE>, but these were sampled
from videos by a friend, so they are probably copyrighted.
<H3>7.3 Enemies</H3>
<H3>7.4 Collision Detection</H3>
These have not been written yet. Please be patient.
