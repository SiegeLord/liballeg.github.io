   Future of Allegro

                     After some deliberation, the people on the Allegro 5   
                     discussion list have decided that Allegro 5 is not     
                     worth pursuing. Hence, it has been scrapped. Not that  
                     it really took off anyway, so nothing much was lost.   
                                                                            
   Peter Wang        However, there has been some discussion about Allegro  
   Member# 23        4 on the developers list, too. Unfortunately, it looks 
   April 2000        like 4.0.3 will be the final release ever. Sad, but    
                     true.                                                  
                                                                            
                     Note that there are plenty of alternatives around, and 
                     the source code is available so anyone who feels up to 
                     it can take over maintenance, if they so wish.         
                                                                            
                     So long Allegators. See you over at www.libsdl.org.

          Bob        always been unhappy with the direction Allegro was

                     23 kept trying to spoil the joke, so his posts were    
                     edited back and forth by him and Matthew, until        
                     Matthew got fed up and removed his editing rights. I
