                     The move from 4.0 to 5.0 went quicker than expected,   
                     so I'm happy to anounce the release of Allegro 5.0!    
                                                                            
                     What's new:                                            
                     - New API                                              
                     - Multiscreen/Multiwindow support                      
                     - DirectX 8 drivers

                     - Merge of FBlend, AllegroGL, DUMB, JGMOD, libnet,     
                     GNE, ppcol, AllegroMP3, AllegPeg and PMask.            
                     - Speech synthesis/recognition                         
                     - Removed duplicate API entries (no more masked_blit   
                     nor draw_sprite or equivalent)                         
                     - DOS port was removed due to lack of support for new

                     How well does the X-Box port work? Did Shawn           
                     contribute to this or something.                       
                                                                            
                     No DOS support is a bummer though...

                     Yeah, Shawn dropped by and merged in his X-Box port    
                     that he was building the whole time.                   
                                                                            
   Bob               About the compression, we know of some issues with the 
   Member# 699       decompression program. Hopefully those will be         
   September 2000    resolved soon so we can fully use LZip.

                     Chris: You're not extracting it properly. You need to  
   X-G               use Kazaa, or else it'll conflict with c:\pr0n and     
   Member# 856       BonziBuddy. There was a feedback doc in this           
   December 2000     somewhere, but I lost it.

                     I'm using a multi node quicktime as the menu for my    
                     current game right now, which is pretty cool, since    
                     you can now script your menus...                       
                                                                            
                     There seems to be a problem with the sound after using 
                     al_video_play_overlay(). After playing a short MPEG, I 
                     get some strange distortions with in game audio.       
                                                                            
                     But this is just nitpicking. It's great work, and the  
                     project converter works like a breeze. After some      
   spellcaster       small manual code adjustments, everything worked like  
   Member# 1,493     a charm.                                               
   September 2001    It's cool that FLI/FLCs are auto converted to MPEG2 if 
                     lame is installed.

                     The speech API seems not to work correctly. Do I have  
                     to install some other packages first?                  
                                                                            
                     4d gfx.. hm. While I think it's a cool name, it's a    
                     bit misleading. If I understand it correctly it's      
                     "just" a bone system which allows for time based       
                     modifiers. (Not sure here, I just run the demo...)

                     Well, for 4d graphics, you tend to lose a lot of the   
                     effect, since you're projecting them back into a 2D    
                     display. However, with the advent of 3D displays, 4D

   Member# 699       already supports 4D graphics, this makes it the

                     The zipped version is rather larger. Why don't you use 
                     lzip? I simply used a single disk linux distro which I 
                     have just for exacty this purpose (running cool linux  
   spellcaster       proggies).

      spellcaster    EDIT: Dan, the 4th dimension is time. From what I've

                     spellcaster: No, it's actually a fourth spacial        
                     dimention. The 4D mesh is then projected back to a 3D  
                     space, which is then projected to a 2D screen. With 3D 
                     displays, we can skip that last step and get to see    
                     all the cool stuff that 4D can bring.                  
                     I do admit that Allegro currently fakes the fourth     
                     dimention by introducing space-time relativity in the  
                     transformation equations. We think that this would     
   Bob               better model the back-projection from 4D to 2D. Of     
   Member# 699       course, there is an optional switch to revert to       
   September 2000    regular "linear" transforms, for 3D displays.
