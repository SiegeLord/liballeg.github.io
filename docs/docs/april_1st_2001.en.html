Subject: [AL] Allegro 4.0 beta<br>

<p>

... is on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/</a>.
<p>
The "beta" status means that if there are no major bugs reported in the
following weeks, the next release will be the final one. Please test it
out and send in as many bug reports as possible. "Beta" also means it is
very close to what the final release will be like, so if you have been
afraid to test out the WIPs, you should try out this release.
<p>

Changes since 3.9.34:
<blockquote>
   I honestly don't know: I haven't being following the mailing lists
   much. I haven't even downloaded it myself to get the change log yet!
   I'm only writing this because Peter insisted it would make the release
   more "official" :-)
</blockquote>

Thanks to all everyone who has helped Allegro get this far: you've all
done a great job! It's certainly come a long way from the version 1.0 on
the Atari ST.
<p>

I totally agree with a 4.0 release.  I think 4.0 has been stable enough for
awhile now to use in end-user software, and most definately better than
3.12.  People who learn about Allegro mistakenly believe the WIP version to
be unsuitable for real programming work and instead go to 3.12, which keeps
them in DOS.  Maybe my opinion is unpopular but I think DOS is dead and
should stay that way, and 3.12 apps even now have problems running under
98, 2k, and Me and such depending on the user's setup and driver
capabilities.
<p>
I almost forgot Shawn started this library.  I don't ever remember seeing
him around as a regular on the lists since him and George Foot started
working on the beginning of the WIP.  I think the cross-platform nature of
Allegro has definately kept Allegro alive as long as it has.  Allegro is
still by far the best library I've seen for games.  It may not be the
fastest, but it covers almost every aspect of game programming (or has user-
created extensions to cover the rest), and it is excellent for beginning
programmers.
<p>
I said this when Allegro 3.0 came about oh so long ago but I will say it
again.  Thank you Shawn for starting the Allegro library because otherwise
I may have never been able to make the software nor learn as much about
games, multimedia programming, and open-source workings as I have.  Thank
you to all of the contributers for keeping Allegro as bug-free as possible
and for providing ports of Allegro -- the Linux port in particular because
I would never have installed Linux when the port came out to learn how to
install and use Linux and how to program under it (and now I'm a big Linux
fan!).  The whole Allegro community is kinda like a "second" family on the
internet for me in its own ways...
<p>
Anyways enough mushy stuff!

The most important change you can have is that it works straight out of the
box under Linux without crashing.  (The ASM code went bad in 3.9.94 and has
to be disabled for a working lib)
<p>
I don't remember whether this has been fixed.. I'll have to try the new release,
but if it DOESN'T, the least that needs to be done is to have it disabled by
default..

It's kinda weird to do a release on the 1st of April ? Is it an
april-fool joke ?

Ok, I have downloaded and compiled it, and it's not an april-fool.
Pfiouuu...

<p>
I guess I'd better explain a few things before this causes any more
confusion, and April Fools' has past by almost 18 hours over here..
<p><ol>
<li>3.9.35 WIP is *NOT* Allegro 4.0 beta.
<li>Check the announcement message's email headers, specifically
       the return path.  Also, look at the time stamp.

<li>Ha ha ha :-)
</ol><p>
Now, before you kill me, I actually think we're pretty close to a
real beta.  To the developers, how about we make the next release
the beta, and release 4.0 before the end of the year?
<p>

PS. How can you be sure *this* message is genuine?

Alphalink..  You.. spoofed.. the Master!
Isn't that about to made illegal in parts of Australia?

Still, it explains why it was written at nearly 4am GMT..

Earlier I was looking at the headers and I couldn't see what was wrong!
Later today, I noticed that it was actually coming from a server in
Australia, the same one that Peter Wang used!
