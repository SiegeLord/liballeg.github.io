This document is in many ways a followup to my
<a href="http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/rtl/index.html">RTL</a> lighting 
demo, so you should probably start by looking at that. It does smooth 
pixel-level lighting in a 320x200 VGA mode, but I've been thinking about 
various other possible approaches, and ways to do similar things in higher 
resolutions or with more colors. In particular I spent most of today 
wandering around Croydon looking for a new flat (my current lease expires 
next month), and in between peering at an assortment of dingy and decrepit 
basements that were invariably described by the landlords as "nice 
attractive studio flats", I had a number of programming ideas which I think 
are worth describing here.
<p>
Note: I haven't attempted to code any of this stuff myself, so I can't 
promise that all these ideas are useful, or even possible for that matter, 
and I cannot give you example source or teach you in detail how to implement 
them. This is more of a brainstorming session than a proper tutorial. 
Someday I would like to try out a few of these techniques and see how well 
they work in practice, but if anyone else beats me to it, or has done 
similar things in the past, I would love to hear about your results...
<p>
There are basically two approaches to realtime lighting. Either the lights 
are part of the environment and illuminate the player sprites as they move 
around, or the lights are part of the gameplay (carried by players, 
triggered by explosions, etc) and they light up the environment. Of course 
you can mix both methods in a single game, but it is generally better to 
concentrate on one or the other. Remember that you can't have a light 
without some dark as well. If you have a well-lit environment to start with, 
there is very little point in giving your player a torch, and those lovely 
illuminated areas around your explosions are at best going to look rather 
weedy. Conversely, if you have lots of lights being triggered by actions 
within the game, you probably want to keep the basic level very dark to get 
the maximum benefit out of them.
<p>
I think that this decision really comes down to how good your artist is. 
From my perspective as a programmer, I cannot draw great background scenery, 
but I can scratch out some rough approximation of what I want, darken it 
down so that nobody can see how bad it really is, and then make it look 
quite cool by programming lots of cool explosions and missile lights over 
the top. But if you have a good artist, they can _draw_ areas of light, 
shadow, and anything else in between, and make it look much nicer than my 
crude programmed effects. Predrawn lights are obviously static in nature, 
but could be made to affect the character sprites as they move around in the 
game world. This approach is obviously a lot less computationally expensive 
than trying to light the entire display in realtime, and much easier to 
disable as an option for slower machines, plus it intrudes less on the 
gameplay: it is more of a nice finishing touch for an existing game than 
something fundamental to the way everything looks.
<p>
If you want to take this approach, the important thing is that the 
background lights (drawn by the artist) must match up exactly with the 
programmed lights used for the character sprites. Nothing would look worse 
than a character stepping out of the shadows into a floodlit area, and then 
the graphic only turning from black to normal colors a few pixels later :-) 
You will probably need a decent editing tool and a lot of patience to 
position all the lights correctly, and this will be much easier if you stick 
to soft-edged illumination rather than any really sharp bright/dark 
contrasts. Also consider that if your lights are all coming from static 
parts of the environment, you mustn't trigger any major lightsources as part 
of the game itself. It would look great to have a swordfight in a dungeon, 
with the players moving in and out of the torchlit areas, but it would look 
really silly if one of them then set off a grenade in the shadows, causing a 
huge explosion but not changing the environment lights at all...
<p>
If you do want to do full environment lighting, you have another two basic 
choices: do you do it on a pixel basis, or only for each drawing primitive? 
Pixel precise lighting involves creating a light map for the scene, 
indicating the amount (and color?) of light falling on every location, and 
then tinting the image accordingly. This lets you cast whatever amount and 
shape of light you like, so it is easy to have torch beams, spotlights, and 
whatever weird flickery or irregularly shaped effects you can think up. 
There is obviously a fair amount of extra processing involved in drawing a 
separate image for the lights, though, and if you go down this route you 
will lose all directional information about the light (you know how much, 
but not where it came from, so bumpmapping effects are impossible).
<p>
A light map will work well if you have a lot of weirdly shaped lights, 
affecting a relatively small number of pixels (eg. for complex lighting in 
low resolution modes). When you have more pixels and only a few simple (ie. 
omnidirectional) lights, it might be better to do the lighting at the same 
time as drawing each sprite or background tile, calculating the amount of 
light that would fall on that object and then tinting the entire thing in 
one pass. A fixed tint color could work if your lights are simple enough and 
your tiles are small enough, or you could gouraud the light level across the 
sprite to get a smoother effect (I'm not sure if it is possible to gouraud 
an entire tile map background quickly enough in an SVGA mode, but it would 
be interesting to try).
<p>
In a 256 color mode, it is easy to use a 256 greyscale value for the light 
level, and a 64k lookup table to blend this with each pixel color. In 
truecolor modes, things get rather more hairy. IMHO it isn't worth trying to 
light a 15 or 16 bit image directly, because your performance will be 
totally destroyed by the endless splitting up into individual RGB 
components, blending those, and then recombining back into a packed pixel 
format. I think it would be much more sensible to work with a 24 bit format 
in memory (or perhaps 32 to maintain good pixel alignment), and reduce this 
to a 15 or 16 bit format at the same time as you copy the finished image 
across to video memory.
<p>
Lighting a 24 bit truecolor pixel is almost the same as for a 256 color one, 
except that you repeat the process three times so as to affect each of the 
individual color components. Strictly speaking you just need to evaluate 
v*l/255, to tint color component <b>v</b> to light level <b>l</b>, but I 
think you will find it much faster to replace this with a 64k lookup table, 
exactly as for the 256 color version. Truecolor code just needs three times 
as many table lookups :-)
<p>
Incidentally, I have a feeling that the MMX instructions could help a great 
deal with the kind of operations required for truecolor lighting. If you 
really want to squeeze the maximum possible performance, it might be worth 
learning the MMX instruction set and designing your code with this in mind, 
so you can make special MMX versions of the key routines at some later date.
<p>
Colored lights are certainly cool, but IMHO they are greatly overrated in 
importance. Machines have just recently got fast enough to support full RGB 
lighting at a reasonable speed, so we have games like Incoming, Forsaken, 
and Unreal flinging out patches of green and purple light every time you 
fire a missile. I can't deny that this looks pretty cool, but I think it is 
being grossly overused, and a few years from now we will look back and 
cringe at how garish these games are. Look at the world around you, or 
practically any film or TV show: the vast majority of lights are white, and 
there are good reasons for this. Subtle tints of orange, blue or pink can do 
wonders to add atmosphere, but you can just alter your source graphics to 
get this same effect. There is no need for red light around a fireplace, 
when you can get the exact same effect by applying white light to some red 
tinted background tiles...
<p>
I think that although colored lights are certainly nice to have, it isn't 
worth sacrificing much performance or resolution in order to achive them. 
I'd rather have some nicely implemented, subtle monochrome lighting effects 
in a high resolution, than full color lighting in a 320x200 mode.
<p>
I think the fastest way to implement pixel based truecolor lighting is not 
in fact to have a separate light map at all, but to combine this with the 
main framebuffer image. If you are targetting a 15 bit screen mode, but 
working with a 24 bit memory format in order to get easy access to 
the individual color components, there are three spare bits in each byte, 
which is IMHO enough to store the light level. It will only give you eight 
shades, but they don't need to start right from black: zero can represent 
the default ambient light level of your scene, and higher values add 
extra light on top of that. This won't allow any really smooth gradients or 
lights that fade in and out, but will be fine for sharp edged things like a 
torch beam, and should provide at least some potential for fades, as long as 
you restrict them to 8 or 16 pixels rather than trying a 100 pixel wide 
light gradient.
<p>
To draw an image in this format, you would store your source graphics as 24 
bit images, but shifted to only use the bottom five bits of each pixel. 
These could be drawn exactly as normal, which would leave zeros in all the 
light bits. You would then add light graphics over the top, which would 
require a custom drawing function to leave the bottom five bits alone while 
adding color to the top three bits (this can most easily be done with a 64k 
lookup table, in basically the same way as the 256 color Allegro translucent 
mode functions). The nice thing about this format is that when an object 
affects both the pixel color and the light level (eg. an explosion), you can 
draw the entire thing in one pass, by using a suitable lookup table that 
will affect both the bottom five and top three bits in the destination. For 
example you could draw a player sprite (normal masked cutout image) carrying 
a torch (additive color in the light bits), or an explosion (additive color 
in both the pixel color and light bits), all in a single pass with just one 
function! It would need some preprocessing to get your source graphics into 
the right format, but I think the results would be well worth it.
<p>
When it came time to blit these 5.3 color components onto the screen, you 
would only need a 256 byte lookup table to convert each value to an actual 
displayable color. For a 24 or 32 bit screen mode, you would just do the 
table lookup and write the result to the screen. For a 15 or 16 bit mode, 
you would need to do three lookups and combine the resulting RGB colors (you 
could have three lookup tables containing preshifted values to speed up this 
process).
<p>
Interesting note: some SVGA cards (including my Matrox) have an obscure 
feature where you can program the palette registers even in truecolor modes, 
to alter the color values produced by the truecolor DAC. This is intended 
for use by utilities that adjust the screen brightness or color balance, but 
by loading a suitable palette you could actually get the card to display a 
24 bit image directly from this 5.3 color+light format! This isn't really a 
useful thing to know, because not many cards support it and there is no 
standard way to access this feature, but I think it is kind of neat :-)
<p>
The trouble with drawing a lighting map is that you have to do it all the 
time, for every pixel on the screen. The standard lighting approach also 
only allows you to light a pixel somewhere between black and the original 
color, but not any brighter: this is exactly how the real world operates, 
but tends to upset artists because it means they have to draw everything 
excessively bright, and can't really tell what it will look like until they 
see it in the game, being displayed at a much darker ambient level. One 
way around this would be to draw the images as you normally want them to 
look, and then add light to this where things are particularly bright, as 
opposed to the more usual taking away of light where things are dark. This 
would allow you to draw the lighting effects directly onto the main 
framebuffer, and only where things are actually happening (eg. around the 
explosions), rather than all over the screen, but unless you are very 
careful it could end up looking a bit weird. When you light things above 
their original shade (ie. multiplying by a value greater than one), you risk 
overflowing and having to clamp the color value, and this will distort the 
shade if some color components clamp before others have reached their 
maximums. Amplifying what was originally a dark image also risks upsetting 
the contrast and tone of the graphic (eg. an artist might use dark blue 
detail pixels in the shadows, even though the object should really be white 
or grey when fully lit), and when things are drawn very dark they will 
suffer from quantizing errors due to limited color bits, that could look 
nasty when more light is added.
<p>
Random thought: I'm 99% sure that this idea is nonsense, but I haven't 
thought it through well enough to be certain of that, so I may as well 
mention it. Instead of adding light above the original pixel color, wouldn't 
it be cool if we could do normal black &lt;-&gt; original lighting, but 
still draw the lights directly onto the main framebuffer and avoid having to 
draw them where nothing is happening? The obvious approach would be to draw 
darkness instead of light, but it isn't so easy to work out where you should 
do this ("everywhere except where there is an explosion" might be rather a 
tricky shape to display, especially if there are lots of explosions :-) But 
you can't start from black and just add light in particular places, because 
if your initial image is black, there is no way to know what color it should 
be lit towards. I have a vague feeling that there might be some really cool 
way to make this work by using subtractive color (CMY format) instead of the 
usual additive RGB layout, but I can't for the life of me figure out exactly 
how. I'm probably just going crazy...
<p>
Ok, let's forget about pixel light maps for a while, and go back to the idea 
of having light objects that illuminate things on a sprite-by-sprite basis. 
Consider this:
<ul><li>
Obvious approach: the further you are from the light, the less brightly you 
are illuminated.
<p><li>
Equally obvious approach: repeat the distance calculation for each corner of 
the sprite, and gouraud those light levels across it.
<p><li>
Problem: that gourauding will have pretty much zero visible effect, because 
the width of a sprite is generally pretty tiny compared to the falloff 
distance of a light. 
<p><li>
Observation: look at someone standing in a dark room with a light in front 
of them, and you will see that they are lit in front but their backside is 
totally dark. Someone else standing further back than them in this same room 
will also have a lit front and dark back, even though the front of this 
second person is further away from the light than the back of the first 
person. <p><li>
Explanation: this is because real life is a true 3d environment, and people 
are not just flat sprite images :-)
<p><li>
Application: calculate both the distance and direction from the light to the 
sprite. Use the distance to work out an overall light level (the further 
away, the dimmer it is). Use the direction to work out which corners are 
closest to the light, and apply the full amount of light to the close ones, 
and maybe half or a quarter that much light to the further away ones 
(obviously with some interpolation for when the light direction doesn't lie 
exactly towards any of the sprite corners).
<p><li>
Implication: the sprite will appear to be rounded out in the third 
dimension, and you will get light that curves around it in a nice and solid 
looking way as the object and/or light move around relative to each other.
<p><li>
Complication: this method is approximating the contours of your sprite as 
something partway between a hemisphere and a pyramid. It will work 
brilliantly for sprites that are those shapes, and should still be close 
enough to look good for any vaguely blob-like graphics, but the more complex 
your character becomes, the more obvious the errors will be. I have no idea 
what this would look like on a normal human type sprite, but would be very 
interested to find out if anyone fancies trying it!
</ul>
<p>
Random thought #2: I love palettes. Even in a truecolor mode, it can be well 
worth storing your input graphics in a 256 color format, even if you end up 
using different palettes for each sprite. Drawing a whole game in 256 colors 
is a major hassle, but there is no problem reducing a single character to a 
paletted format, and it allows so many more cunning effects to be used. 
Palettes can be changed around on the fly much more easily than truecolor 
pixels can be tinted, and you can feed 256 color pixels into a lookup table 
to do all sorts of things that would be prohibitive with a 16 or 24 bit 
input. Artists love truecolor, but clever programmers can do much more 
interesting things with palettes, and they aren't really so restrictive as 
long as you can use more than one of them at a time.
<p>
By using two input graphics, two lookup tables, and some cunning 
preprocessing, I think it is possible to avoid the errors of the 
abovementioned sprite gourauding method, and get 100% correct bumpmapped 
lighting, complete with realtime specular highlights, for only about twice 
the expense of drawing a normal lit sprite!
<p>
The first step is to draw your sprite image, and at the same time to make a 
greyscale heightmap for it (black representing the lowest points, and white 
the highest). Next, you need to write a utility that will convert this 
greyscale image into a gradient bitmap. Measuring the gradients is easy 
enough: just take the difference between the pixel height above and below a 
point to get a vertical gradient, and the difference between the left and 
right pixel heights to get the horizontal slope. How best to encode this 
orientation into a single 8 bit pixel is rather more of a challenge :-) You 
could just use 4 bits each for the X and Y slopes, giving a -8 &lt;-&gt; 7 
range for each value, but I think it might be better to convert this into 
spherical coordinates and store it as an angle (probably best to use 6 bits 
for this) and elevation (2 bits).
<p>
Ingame, when it comes time to draw the sprite you need to work out what 
direction the light is coming from, converting this into the same single 
byte format that you used for the gradient bitmap. Strictly speaking, in a 
2d game you can only ever have lights coming from the same plane as the 
sprite, so the elevations would always be zero, but I think things would 
look much better if you bodged things to put the lights on a plane a bit 
above the sprites, so the elevation will increase as the sprite gets closer 
to the light.
<p>
A pixel is fully lit if the light is perpendicular to it, ie. if the light 
direction is the exact opposite of the pixel orientation vector. As the 
light moves further away from this direction, it becomes darker, the exact 
amount being the dot product of the two vectors. The trick to doing this 
efficiently in realtime is that, having packed both vectors into a single 
byte, we can precalculate a 64k lookup table listing the combinations of any 
possible light and pixel directions, which will just tell us how much light 
strikes this surface when it is lit from this particular direction. In other 
words we can use the Allegro draw_lit_sprite() function, passing it our 
gradient bitmap and the packed light direction as our "light color", and it 
will output a greyscale light map for the sprite! We can then use a more 
conventional lighting lookup table to tint each sprite color pixel according 
to that light map, and draw the resulting bumpmapped color to the screen. 
Obviously the fastest way to implement this would be to write a special 
function that would combine both table lookups into a single operation, 
avoiding the need to store the temporary light map image.
<p>
With this scheme, you could quite easily add specular highlights for zero 
additional code at runtime. These are the "shiny spots" that adorn almost 
all real world objects, although they are most pronounced on metallic 
surfaces. They occur where the light is reflected directly from the surface 
towards your eye, rather than being absorbed and then reemitted equally in 
all directions as would happen with a normal dull surface. The highlight 
color is unaffected by the shade of the surface that is reflecting it, so 
they are almost always white. They don't happen in the same place as the 
brightest normal lighting (ie. where the light is falling directly onto the 
surface), but where the surface is reflecting the light directly towards 
your eye, ie. where the angle between the direction you are looking at it 
from and the surface normal is the same as the angle between the light 
direction and the surface normal. Specular highlights have a much sharper 
falloff than diffuse lights, so they only affect a few pixels in a very 
confined location, but varying the exact falloff curve and the brightness of 
the highlight can give a convincing effect of many different textures and 
material types (if you have a copy of 3DS, have a fiddle with with the 
specular lighting parameters in the material editor to get an idea how this 
works).
<p>
Because specular highlights occur at different angles to the normal 
brightest light, they cannot be stored in the same bits as the main light 
color. But because they are so sharp and clearly defined, they don't require 
nearly such a smooth gradient. I think you could store an adequately 
detailed combined light level in a single byte, using 6 bits for the diffuse 
light level and 2 bits for the specular intensity. The code to display a 
bumpmapped object would remain unchanged, just using different lookup 
tables. Instead of outputting an 8 bit greyscale level, the table used to 
combine the two direction vectors would do two individual computations (it 
doesn't need to know about the view direction, because in a 2d game that is 
always directly above the sprite), and output a combined 6.2  light value. 
The lighting table would then use the low 6 bits of this input to tint the 
sprite pixel color, and add some amount of white to the result depending on 
the top two bits of the light value. Result: realtime specular highlights, 
"for free"...
<p>
By varying the two tables described above, I suspect that all sorts of other 
interesting effects would be possible, for example a variant of the classic 
3d chrome effect. That works by applying a plasma texture to a polygon with 
u/v coordinates calculated from the transformed polygon normal, but I'm sure 
something very similar could be done in 2d by combining a heightfield bitmap 
and direction vector with suitable lookup tables.
