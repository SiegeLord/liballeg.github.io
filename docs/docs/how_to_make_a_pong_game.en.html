    <h1>How to make a Pong Game, by
    <a href="mailto:smahmood@uwaterloo.ca">Sheraz Mahmood</a>
    </h1>
    <p>Ok first off we are trying to make pong
    (using DJGPP and ALLEGRO), this is going to be a 2 player
    game (2 paddles). How does this game work will we have a ball
    which is bouncing around on the screen, and you must stop it
    from going off your side of the screen using a paddle. To start
    off we have to make the paddles and the ball for the
    game.

      <img src="how_to_make_a_pong_game/ball.png" width="43" height="42"
           border="0" alt="Ball graphic"><br>BALL<br>
       <img src="how_to_make_a_pong_game/bar.png" width="5" height="50"
            border="0" alt="Paddle graphic"><br>PADDLE<br>
    </center>
    <p>Hay look there they are (you are going to have to convert
    these into bmp files for allegro to read them). If you already
    don't know this allegro can take files such as pictures,
    sounds, etc and put them in a nice neat file which can be used
    in a game or other things. To do this we have to load up
    GRABBER.EXE. Click on "Objects" now goto "NEW" then select RLE
    SPRITE. You should now be asked for a name put in "BALL". Now
    do that again and for the name now put "BAR". Now this time
    when you goto "NEW" choose PALLETE. Name this "PAL"
    <p>As you can probably see that everything that you have done
    has had a result on side list. Click on the first thing on the
    list (Should be the "BALL". Now goto "File" and select read
    BMP, now go find the file which has the picture of the BALL.
    When you have done that go back to "OBJECTS" and select GRAB.
    You should now select the size of the picture and it is done
    you now have your first sprite in the datafile. Now select the
    second item in the list should be "BAR". Now do what we just
    did with the BALL to the BAR. When you have done that select
    the PALLETE and now just choose "GRAB" form the "OBJECTS" menu.
    When you have done this in the place where it says "header" put
    down "pong.h". Now one last thing to do select "File" and then
    save. Save the file in the same place where you are going to
    have the source code.
    <p>If you have not gotten this, don't worry about it, the only
    reason that I did it was to show you how to use "GRABBER.EXE".
    Anyways I have done all of this for you and saved it in a zip
    file (plus the zip has the source code and the sound sample for
    the game.) which you can download at the end of the article.
    <h2>STARTING OUT:</h2>
    <p>Load up RHIDE or another editor to use with DJGPP. I will
    not explain how to use RHIDE but will tell you how to add
    ALLEGRO into your porgrams in RHIDE. Ok we have to make a new
    project. Select "PROJECT" now select "Open Project". Goto where
    the GRABBER DATA file is and put in "pong" in the file name and
    click ok. Now you have a new project. Now click on "Options"
    then "libraries", put in "ALLEG" in the first spot and select
    the button beside it then click on "OK". Now select "PROJECT"
    and then "add item". Put in "pong.c", and now select "OK".
    There ladies and gental men we have our first project.
    <h2>ON WITH THE GAME:</h2>
    <p>You should now be in the editor window with the "pong.c"
    file loaded. We need to first start off by including the files
    that are required for the game.<br>
    <br>
<pre>
<code>   /*Used for the standerd input/output functions*/
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   /*Allegro function header file*/
   #include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
   
   /*Pong header file*/
   #include "pong.h"
</code>
</pre>
    You are probably wondering what the "pong.h" file is for. Well
    when you created (or not) the datafile in the grabber utility it
    created a header file to store all the information of the
    datafile. We will be using this header file to get the data off
    of the datafile.Now the main function. If you type this all up
    and then execute it, it would run the program then exit (most
    likely you will not see much). Now lets load up the pong
    datafile. To start off we first have to make a global variable
    for all the other functions to use 
<pre>
<code>   int main(void)
   {
      /*Init Allegro equipment*/
      allegro_init();
   
      /*Install the timer*/
      install_timer();
   
      /*Install the keyboard*/
      install_keyboard();
   
      /*Initizlise the joystick*/
      initialise_joystick();
   
      /*Install the mouse*/
      install_mouse();
   
      /*Set the sound system*/
      printf("Setting up the Sound.");
   
      if(install_sound(DIGI_AUTODETECT,MIDI_AUTODETECT,NULL) != 0) {
         /*Shutdown Allegro*/
         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error setting up Sound\n%s\n\n", allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      }
   
      /*Set the graphice mode*/
      printf("Setting up graphics mode 640x480.\n");
      
      if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, 640, 480, 0, 0) != 0) {
         /*Shutdown Allegro*/
         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error setting graphics mode\n%s\n\n", allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      }
      
      /*Shut down Allegro*/
      allegro_exit();
      
      return 0;
   }
</code>
</pre>
    There it is the main function. Well if you have not already
    guessed from reading the code that we have just Initizlised the
    allegro library, installed the timer function, installed the
    keyboard, initilized the joystick, installed the mouse, setup
    the sound card, set the graphics, and last of all exited the
    whole program. <br>
     
<pre>
<code>      /*Get the Pong DataFile*/
      DATAFILE *pong_datafile=NULL;
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>This should be before the main function. Now lets open the
    datafile, this should go in the main function.<br>
<pre>
<code>      .
      .
      .
      
      /*Install the mouse*/
      install_mouse();
      
      if((pong_datafile=load_datafile("pong.dat"))==NULL) {
         /*Shutdown Allegro*/
         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error loading \"pong.dat\"\n%s\n\n", allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      }
      
      .
      .
      .
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     <br>
     
    <p>What this basicly does is load the datafile "pong.dat" into
    the pointer variable "pong_datafile" then it checks it see if
    it was loaded proparly. If it was not then it exits ALLEGRO
    then prints out an error message and then exits the whole
    program.<br>
    <p>Ok so far you shoud have this.
<pre>
<code>   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
   
   /*Include the pong header file for the finding things in the datafile*/
   #include "pong.h"
   
   /*Get the Pong DataFile*/
   DATAFILE *pong_datafile=NULL;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      /*Init Allegro equipment*/
      allegro_init();
      
      /*Install the timer*/
      install_timer();
      
      /*Install the keyboard*/
      install_keyboard();

         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error loading \"pong.dat\"\n%s\n\n", allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      }
      /*Set the sound system*/
      printf("Setting up the Sound.");
      if(install_sound(DIGI_AUTODETECT,MIDI_AUTODETECT,NULL) != 0) {
         /*Shutdown Allegro*/
         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error setting up Sound\n%s\n\n", allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      
      }
      
      /*Set the graphice mode*/
      printf("Setting up graphics mode 640x480.\n");
      
      if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, 640, 480, 0, 0) != 0) {
         /*Shutdown Allegro*/
         allegro_exit();
         /*Print error message*/
         printf("Error setting graphics mode\n%s\n\n",
         allegro_error);
         exit(1);
      }
      
      /*Shut down Allegro*/
      allegro_exit();
      
      return 0;
   }
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>Now its time to set up the direction constants. These
    constants tell us the direction that the ball will be
    traviling.<br>
<pre>
<code>      /*Direction consts*/
      #define DOWN_RIGHT   0
      #define UP_RIGHT     1
      #define DOWN_LEFT    2
      #define UP_LEFT      3
</code>
</pre>
    <p>This should go after including the header files (at least
    that is where I like them to be). Basicly what these constants
    tell us is just the direction so if you were to pick direction
    0 it would be DOWN_RIGHT, or direction UP_RIGHT which would be
    1.<br>
    <p>Now on to the direction variable, this variable is used to
    set the direction that the ball is traviling. Along with this I
    will set the x and y positions of the ball.<br>
<pre>
<code>
      int ball_x; //The location of the Ball
      int ball_y; //The location of the Ball
      int direction=0; //The direction the Ball is going
</code>
</pre>
    <p>Now its time to setup the variables for the two paddles that
    the players will be using.<br>
<pre>
<code>
      int bar1_y=30; //Player 1 Bar position
      int bar2_y=430; //Player 2 Bar position
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>You might be wondering why I have bar1_y=30 and bar2_y=430.
    Well my reason is that the position of the player 1 bar will be
    in to the top most corner of the screen which is 30 (this is
    becasue the first 30 y pixels are taken to show the score). And
    player 2 will have its bar at the botton mose corner (the reason
    why this is not 430 because the bar is 50 pixels high and
    430+50=480 which is the height of the screen.<br>
    <p>Now onto the the score variables.<br>
<pre>
<code>
      int score_p1=0; //Player 1 score
      int score_p2=0; //Plater 2 score
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>This I belive is pretty self explanotary. The speed
    variables are next these variables are used to set the speed
    that the ball will be traviling, so lets set them.<br>
<pre>
<code>      int speed=2; //The speed of the Ball
      int amout_of_hits=0; //Used to set the speed of the Ball
</code>
</pre>
    <p>Ok the first variable "speed" is the used as the current
    speed and the speed that will be changed. Now the second
    variable "amount_of_hits" is used to set the speed of the ball,
    this is done by finding the remander of the amount of hits
    divided by 10. Now onto the graphics of the game.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Double Buffering:</h2>
    <p>Double buffering is a nice little technique which reduces
    flickering. Normally when you would write something you would
    display what ever you wanted to go onto the screen, this would
    cause the screen to flicker because when every you would
    display something you would have to clear the whole sreen then
    display it. But using double buffering what you would do is put
    everthing that you wanted to display on a virtual screen (a
    bitmap in the memory) and then copy that whole virtual screen
    to the acctual screen.<br>
    <p>Lets create the double buffering feature for the game. Ok
    lets start off by creating the Virtual screen.<br>
<pre>
<code>      BITMAP *buffer; //The screen buffer of double buffering
</code>
</pre>
    <p>Ok so we have the virtual screen. Now what do we do, well we
    will have to create and clear the buffer. To do this all we
    have to do is put these lines after we load up the pallete in
    the main function:<br>
<pre>
<code>      .
      .
      .
      
      /*Set the pallete for the sprites*/
      set_pallete(pong_datafile[pong_pal].dat);
      
      /*Clear and Create the buffer*/
      buffer=Create_bitmap(640,480);
      clear(buffer);
      
      .
      .
      .
</code>
</pre>
    <p>Now lets place the ball in the center of the screen.<br>
<pre>
<code>      .
      .
      .
      
      /*Set the pallete for the sprites*/
      set_pallete(pong_datafile[pong_pal].dat);
      
      /*Clear and Create the buffer*/
      buffer=Create_bitmap(640,480);
      clear(buffer);
      
      /*Set he Ball position*/
      ball_x=SCREEN_W/2;
      ball_y=35;
      
      .
      .
      .
</code>
</pre>
    <p>Now we start off by creating a function called
    pong_game(void). What does this function do? It controls all
    that is going on in the game. Here it is:<br>
<pre>
<code>   void pong_game(void)
   {
      /*Set the first random direction the ball will be traviling*/
      direction=random_direction();
      
      /*Play the game while the ESC key is not pressed*/
      while(!key[KEY_ESC]) {
         /*Move the Ball*/
         move_ball();
         /*Respond to the input*/
         key_respond();
         
         /*Put the information on the Screen*/
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,"Player 1 Score:",
                 150,0,254);
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,itoa(score_p1,NULL,10),
                 text_length(pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,
                 "Player 1 Score:")+150,0,10);
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,"Player 2 Score:",
                 350,0,254);
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,itoa(score_p2,NULL,10),
                 text_length(pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,
                             "Player 2 Score:")+350,0,10);
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,"keyboard",0,0,255);
         textout(buffer,pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,"joystick",
                 640-text_length(pong_datafile[pong_text].dat,"joystick"),
                 0,255);
         /*Draw a line to set the boundries*/
         line(buffer,0,30,640,30,10);
         
         /*Put the buffer screen on the screen*/
         blit(buffer,screen,0,0,0,0,640,480);
         
         /*Clear the buffer*/
         clear(buffer);
      }
      return;
   }
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>Don't worry about the first part, I will explain all of that
    later. All I really want to explain is that it puts up the
    information about the users like the score and which side is
    for the joystick and which is the one for the keyboard. At the
    end the buffer is copyed to the screen and then the buffer is
    erased, note not the screen (this is what reduces
    flickering).<br>
    <p>Ok what do we have now. Currently the program opens and then
    does all the graphics stuff and the sound stuff and the input
    devices stuff. After all of that is done we have to load up the
    pong_game function, we do that by putting the line
    <code>pong_game();</code> in the main function, mainly after we
    set up the buffer and the ball position. So it goes like this:
<pre>
<code>      /*Set the pallete for the sprites*/
      set_pallete(pong_datafile[pong_pal].dat);
      
      /*Clear and Create the buffer*/
      buffer=create_bitmap(640,480);
      clear(buffer);
      
      /*Set the Ball position*/
      ball_x=SCREEN_W/2;
      ball_y=35;
      
      /*Play the Game*/
      pong_game();
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     <br>
     
    <p>Now it is time to put together the random_direction
    function. The purpose of this is to return a random direction
    that the balls will be traviling (you remember the direction
    constants that we put together before). Here it is:<br>
<pre>
<code>   int random_direction(void)
   {
      return random()%3;
   }
</code>
</pre>
    <p>That is not that hard. If you are wondering why is have
    random()%3; well the reason is that we have the direction from
    numbers 0 to 3 which is 4 numbers. So the random function will
    return a number and we will find a remainder which is mod by
    3.<br>
    <p>Well there is the random function now on to the boing
    function. What is this you may ask well this is the function
    that will play a music file (This music file is in the zip that
    I have along with this document). Here it is:<br>
<pre>
<code>   void boing(void)
   {
      play_sample(pong_datafile[pong_boing].dat,255,255,1000,0);
      return;
   }
</code>
</pre>
    <br>
     
    <p>The play_sample function is involved with the allegro
    library. The play_sample function reads the sound sample from
    the datafile and then plays it in both speakers, then the
    second last argument means that it will be played at normal
    speed and the last argument tells us that it will not loop.<br>
    <p>Now for the second last function it is called move_ball:<br>
    <br>
<pre>
<code>   void move_ball(void)
   {
      /*Set the speed according to the amout of hits*/
      if(amout_of_hits%10==0 &amp;&amp; amout_of_hits!=0) {
         speed++;
         amout_of_hits++;
      }
   
      /*Respond to the direction the ball is traviling*/
      switch(direction) {
         case DOWN_RIGHT:
            ball_x+=speed;
            ball_y+=speed;
            if(ball_x&gt;600) {
               if((ball_y&gt;=bar2_y-20) &amp;&amp;( ball_y&lt;=bar2_y+65)) {
                  direction=DOWN_LEFT;
                  amout_of_hits++;
                  boing();
               }
               else {
                  score_p1++;
                  ball_x=SCREEN_W/2;
                  ball_y=35;
                  direction=random_direction();
               }
            }
            else {
               if(ball_y&gt;420)
               direction=UP_RIGHT;
            }
            break;
         case UP_LEFT:
            ball_x-=speed;
            ball_y-=speed;
            if(ball_x&lt;5) {
               if((ball_y&gt;=bar1_y-20) &amp;&amp;( ball_y&lt;=bar1_y+65)) {

                  boing();
               }
               else {
                  direction=random_direction();
                  score_p2++;
                  ball_x=SCREEN_W/2;
                  ball_y=35;
               }
            }
            else {
               if(ball_y&lt;30)
               direction=DOWN_LEFT;
            }
            break;
         case UP_RIGHT:
            ball_x+=speed;

    Move ball checks to see if the ball has gone over any of the
    users sides and then moves the ball according to the speed that
    is provided. At the end it adds 1 to the number of hits.

    This is the last function in the pong game. What it does it
    check to see what input the users have given to the players and
    then reacts to them. So if the users pushs the up arrow then
    the paddle on his side will go up or no move if it can not move
    anymore. I must also add that where the computer checks to see
    if the joystick up or down botton is pressed it also checks to
    see if the A and Z keys were pressed (in case you don't have a
    joystick).<br>
     
    <p>Basicly when you put all these functions together you get
    the whole game. which can be found in this zip file.
