As of the 3.9.x work-in-progress series which is current at the time of this 
writing, Allegro has been ported to DOS (djgpp and Watcom), Windows (MSVC, 
mingw32, and RSXNTDJ), Linux (console and X) and BeOS. By the time you read 
this, version 4.0 will probably be out, or perhaps even some later release 
with support for more different platforms. Allegro gives you the exact same 
library functions no matter where you are running it, and this makes it very 
easy to produce versions of your program for all of these systems: in 
theory, a simple recompile should be all the porting work required. Things 
are rarely quite that simple in the real world, though, so you will probably 
need to tweak a few things to get your program working on each new platform. 
This document tries to guess what the most likely problem areas will be, in 
hopes that you can avoid them right from the start rather than getting stuck 
having to do lots of fiddling later on. Some of these are Allegro things, 
but most are general C things: in either case, please let me know if you can 
think of any other problem areas that I left out!
<ul><li>
The most obvious change required to get DOS sources working on other 
platforms is that you have to write END_OF_MAIN() just after your main() 
function. This macro is a noop in the DOS version of the library, but in the 
Windows version it does magic to turn your standard ANSI main() function 
into a Microsoft-style WinMain(), and on Unix platforms it does a different 
sort of magic to let Allegro capture the value of your argv[0] parameter 
(which is needed for locating the config files).
<p><li>
Give your main() function the correct prototype. ANSI C says that it is 
allowed to be either 'int main()', or 'int main(int argc, char *argv[])', 
and that it should return zero for success, or a nonzero exit code if 
something went wrong. It is not correct to declare main as returning void, 
or to just fall off the bottom of it without returning a value.
<p><li>
Don't use any nonstandard library functions. Obviously if you call DirectX 
functions, that will only work on Windows, or if you call DPMI functions, 
that will only work on a DPMI system like djgpp. So you should avoid using 
platform specific headers like conio.h, or platform specific parts of 
Allegro like the GDI interfacing functions. Stick to ANSI standard 
functions, Allegro library functions, and any other libraries that are 
available on all the platforms you want to support. For instance the rand() 
function is specified by ANSI as part of libc, but random() is not, so 
portable code should use rand() in preference to random().
<p><li>
Related to the above: on some platforms rand() only returns a 16 bit value, 
so don't assume that the higher bits will contain anything useful (djgpp 
rand() does return a full 32 bit result, but you can't count on this).
<p><li>
One of the least standard aspects of libc is how to read what files are 
contained in a directory. Most DOS and Windows compilers have some kind of 
findfirst() and findnext() functions, but they differ as to exactly what 
these are called and what parameters they take. Posix systems (Unix, djgpp) 
have opendir() and readdir(), but these are missing from MSVC. So either 
don't do such things, or use the Allegro for_each_file() function, which is 
supported on all platforms.
<p><li>
Take a look at the "C Extensions" page in the gcc docs. There are many 
things in here which are a) very cool, and b) not supported by compilers 
other than gcc, so if you want your code to be portable, you unfortunately 
can't use them. You must likewise avoid any MSVCisms such as __stdcall, 
__declspec, etc, but these aren't nearly so tempting as all the funky stuff 
that gcc can do :-)
<p><li>
Don't declare C functions as being inline, because not all compilers support 
it. If you want to do this for optimization reasons, use the Allegro INLINE 
macro instead, which is defined to be inline for compilers that support 
that, __inline for stupid compilers like MSVC that enjoy punctuation 
characters, and nothing at all for even stupider compilers that don't know 
anything about it. You have to be extra careful if you want to declare 
inline functions inside a header file, though. Allegro manages to make this 
work on all compilers through a combination of the AL_INLINE() macro and the 
inline.c library source file, but this is nasty stuff and not easy to get 
working in all combinations of optimized and debug builds, so I would advise 
you to avoid it if at all possible. If not, you can copy the way that 
Allegro does it, but you'll need to add your own equivalent of inline.c to 
your projects, and somehow arrange for this to instantiate static copies of 
all your own inline functions while avoiding the ones from allegro.h (which 
have already been instantiated once by inline.c). Alternatively you can not 
bother with an inline.c file, but in that case your program is likely to 
fail in non-optimized debug builds, and on compilers like Watcom that don't 
support inline functions at all.
<p><li>
Don't use inline asm! (this should be fairly obvious). If you absolutely do 
have to write things in asm, make a prototype version in C first, and then 
comment it out before you start working on the optimized asm version. That 
way, if you later want to run the code on a different platform you can 
comment out the asm, restore your original C version, and not have to 
rewrite the whole thing. You may also find that asm code is more easily 
portable if you write it as external .s files, or perhaps using NASM, rather 
than inlining it within your C sources. There are still some minor 
differences between platforms (for example djgpp prefixes symbol names with 
an underscore, while Linux does not), but these can easily be solved with a 
few preprocessor macros. It is quite straightforward to share external asm 
source files between djgpp, Intel Linux, and Intel BeOS platforms, and 
Allegro even manages to use the same code with MSVC and Watcom as well! This 
is much better than inline asm, which has to be completely rewritten for 
every new compiler, but obviously still a long way short of being truly 
portable, since Intel asm is unlikely to do the right thing on a PPC, MIPS, 
or Alpha machine :-)
<p><li>
Be careful about writing things in C++, especially where the newer language 
features are concerned, because not all compilers support the entire 
language spec yet. In particular namespaces and exceptions are problematic, 
but even template instantiation can work in different ways on some systems. 
These problems are likely to become less as time goes by, and even today are 
far less awkward than they were a couple of years ago, but your code will be 
far more portable if you stick to the original core of the language 
(classes, inheritance, virtual functions, etc).
<p><li>
Turn on strict warning mode in your compiler, and listen to whatever it 
complains about. Something that is a warning on one platform is liable to 
turn into an error on another, and even if you do manage to get away with 
them, compiler warnings are a sign of dubious code and so always worth 
fixing.
<p><li>
Link with the debugging version of the Allegro library, because this 
includes some extra checks that will warn you about potential problem areas. 
But don't forget to switch back to using the optimized library before you 
release your final program, since the debug version is much slower.
<p><li>
In some compilers, char variables are signed, while in others, they are 
unsigned. If you care about this (ie. if you are doing math or storing 
negative values in single bytes), you should always be explicit and declare 
your types as signed char or unsigned char. You don't need to do that for 
short, int, and long variables, though, which are always signed unless you 
specify otherwise.
<p><li>
Remember that DOS compilers (and I think also Windows ones) only have a 
limited stack size, unlike on Unix where the stack can dynamically grow to 
use all virtual memory. So don't declare huge local arrays that will be 
allocated on the stack: this works on Linux, but not elsewhere.
<p><li>
If you are developing DOS programs under Windows, every now and then you 
should drop down into clean DOS mode and test whether they run when using 
CWSDPMI as your DPMI server. This is because CWSDPMI supports some DPMI 1.0 
functions that are missing from the Microsoft DPMI implementations, and 
which allow djgpp to trap illegal memory accesses such as trying to 
dereference a NULL pointer. If your program works under Windows but not with 
CWSDPMI, you almost certainly have some pointer bugs, and you really do need 
to fix these because they are liable to come back later in an even worse 
form, and will cause endless hassles as you move the code to different 
platforms.
<p><li>
Don't make assumptions about how the compiler will lay out your structures 
in memory. For example if you write:
<pre>
   typedef struct MYSTRUCT
   {
      char a;
      short b;
      int c;
   };
</pre>
you might expect that sizeof(MYSTRUCT) will be 7, but in fact most Intel 
compilers will pad it to 8 bytes. It is quite possible, though, that some 
might pad to 12, or that a future 64 bit platform might make that int 
variable twice as large as you are expecting. So you need to avoid code 
which cares about such changes, and be sure to use sizeof() whenever you 
need to allocate space for a data structure.
<p><li>
Don't use the fread() or pack_fread() functions for loading anything other 
than streams of single byte data, and likewise don't use fwrite() or 
pack_fwrite() for saving them. If you do, your saved files will randomly 
change format depending on how your compiler decides to pad your memory 
structures, and they also won't be portable to machines with a different 
processor endianess. To read and write binary files in a portable way, you 
need to transfer each 16 or 32 bit value in turn, using functions like 
pack_igetw() and pack_igetl() (or pack_mgetw() and pack_mgetl(), depending 
on the endianess of your disk file format). The Allegro src/bmp.c file is a 
pretty good example of how to do this correctly.
<p><li>
Avoid using the Allegro dat2s utility in portable code, because it generates 
asm source files, and these won't work on platforms with radically different 
asm syntices (it would be far more portable if it output C code, but neither 
gcc nor MSVC is able to compile C sources containing large initialized 
arrays, so that doesn't work very well in practice). Strangely enough, the 
exedat utility seems to work far more reliably on different platforms, so 
that should probably be your first port of call when it comes to merging 
data resources into the executable. If portability is your top priority, 
though, the safest thing is not to use either of these, and stick with 
loading your data from external files.
<p><li>
On DOS, filenames are in 8.3 format, and there is no case variation. On 
Windows, they can be longer and the case is remembered, but case is not 
significant, so that for instance "MyFile" refers to the same thing as 
"myfILe". On Unix, filenames can be long and case is significant, so that 
"MyFile" and "myfILe" are totally different things. Urgh! If you want to be 
portable, stick to 8.3 format lowercase names, and don't use anything but 
regular alphanumeric characters. You can be pretty sure that this sort of 
name will work anywhere.
<p><li>
DOS and Windows tend to use '\' as a file path separator, but also 
understand '/'. Unix systems only use '/', so to be portable, you should 
always use a '/' yourself as well.
<p><li>
Be careful when munging filenames around, because what works on one system 
may mean something totally different on another. Allegro provides a few 
functions that may be useful for this kind of work, and which will do 
appropriate even if slightly different things on each platform, such as 
fix_filename_case() and fix_filename_path().
<p><li>
Most DOS and Windows compilers will pass wildcard commandline arguments 
straight through to your program, but on Unix, these are expanded into a 
list of individual files by the shell, before your program even starts to 
run. With djgpp, the Unix shell expansion will be emulated unless you write 
a __crt0_glob_function() to override this behavior. Portable programs 
obviously cannot count on whether their arguments will already have been 
expanded or not, so they should be designed to work either way around. For 
example the dat utility is constructed in such a way that it can be passed 
long lists of filenames by a Unix style shell, but internally it also calls 
for_each_file() on each argument, so the expansion will still happen if it 
is given raw wildcard parameters.
<p><li>
On DOS and Windows, programs tend to just install into a single directory, 
but on Unix, system administrators will like you much better if your program 
knows how to exist in a multiuser environment, and adheres to the Filesystem 
Hierarchy Standard (FHS). You can read all the details on
<a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a>, but 
here's a quick summary:
<p>
Most importantly, you need to distinguish between read-only data, global 
modifiable data, and user-specific data. Assuming that someone has 
downloaded your game, unpacked it, compiled it, and run it, it is a good 
thing for your game not to modify the directory where it is installed, so 
that this directory could be mounted read-only. If you want to save out 
variable data such as a hiscore table, put this in the /var/games directory 
(or if you need many such files, create a /var/games/mygame subdirectory, 
and put your data in that). But don't forget that there can be many users on 
the same machine, and they may not all want to share the same stored 
information! Anything that is specific to the current user, such as save 
game files or controller configuration, should go in their home directory, 
which can be located by reading the HOME environment variable (eg. char 
*mydir = getenv("HOME")). Again, if you need to put many files here, you can 
create a subdirectory for yourself.
<p>
That is probably enough to make your game work well in a multiuser 
environment, but if you want to go further and set up a really beautiful 
configuration (for example to provide a "make install" target as well as the 
regular compilation rules) you should be aware of the following locations:
<p>
Most binaries go in /usr/local/bin, but games should be placed in 
/usr/local/games. This directory is only for the executable itself, which is 
specific to the current machine architecture, and can be run directly by the 
user.
<p>
Shared libraries and other executable code go in /usr/local/lib. The 
contents of this directory are also specific to one machine architecture, 
but the user does not run them directly (for example the Allegro shared 
library goes in here).
<p>
Non-executable resources go in /usr/local/share/, or for games, 
/usr/local/share/games/. The point of this directory is that it contains 
material which remains the same no matter what type of computer your game is 
running on, so if someone has a network containing a mix of i386 machines, 
Alpha boxes, and PPC systems, they can still mount these files over the 
network and use the same data on all hardware. So this is the place to put 
your graphics, sounds, and level data. If you have more than one file to 
put in here, make a subdirectory to contain them all.
<p><li>
Don't use specific driver names in your programs, because for example there 
is no GFX_VESA2L in the Windows version, and no MIDI_WIN32 on Linux. Except 
in very specific circumstances (for example when you are writing the setup 
program :-) you should always use the autodetect parameters, and let the 
user decide whether to override this autodetection by using the setup 
program or editing the config file. Quite apart from the portability issues, 
hardcoding your driver selection is a bad idea because not everybody has the 
same hardware as you, so even though one particular graphics driver is the 
best on your machine, it might not work at all for someone else.
<p><li>
If you absolutely do need to write special code that depends on specific 
hardware drivers, use the preprocessor to test whether they are available on 
the current platform. For example if you want a routine that will do one 
thing when using a mode-X graphics mode but a different thing on all other 
drivers, you can write:
<pre>
   #ifdef GFX_MODEX
      if (gfx_driver->id == GFX_MODEX) {
	 /* do funky mode-X graphics stuff */
      }
      else
   #endif
      {
	 /* do normal graphics stuff */
      }
</pre>
This code will simply not bother to compile the mode-X routines if there is 
no mode-X driver on the current platform, and it is better than checking for 
the platform itself, because this test will adapt to things like the Linux 
version where mode-X support might or might not be available, depending on 
what options were passed to the configure script.
<p><li>
Stick to standard screen resolutions like 320x200, 640x480, and 800x600 (and 
no, 512x384 and 640x400 are not supported by all hardware). For optimal 
portability, hedge your bets by supporting a couple of different 
resolutions, in case one of them decides not to work.
<p><li>
If your program uses a hicolor or truecolor mode (ie. anything more than 8 
bit color), you should support all possible hicolor and truecolor modes. Not 
every system will be capable of every color depth, but Allegro makes it 
trivial to handle multiple depths, and you can be pretty sure that at least 
one out of 15, 16, 24, or 32 bit color will be available (except in lowres 
modes: many DOS drivers only support 8 bit color for resolutions smaller 
than 640x480).
<p><li>
Page flipping and triple buffering are cool, and hardware accelerated 
blitting with your graphics stored in offscreen vram is very cool, but these 
methods are far less portable than drawing onto a memory bitmap and then 
simply blasting the result across to the screen. If you want to use the more 
optimized methods, I suggest implementing them as options alongside a simple 
double buffer, as shown in the Allegro demo game and exupdate example 
program.
<p><li>
When you want to set a graphics mode but don't particularly care what type 
of graphics mode (for example in order to display the dialog that will be 
used to select your real resolution), use the GFX_SAFE driver. When you 
request a GFX_SAFE mode, Allegro will poke around trying to find whatever 
resolution is supported on the current system, and if it can't find anything 
at all, it will abort the program with a (hopefully descriptive :-) error 
message, so you don't need to bother checking for errors yourself.
<p><li>
Remember that not all platforms have any solid existence outside of Allegro. 
For example Windows programs cannot produce output or read keyboard input 
until they have opened up a window to do this in, and likewise the stdout 
from an X program may not be visible if it was launched from inside a GUI 
interface. So you should always set a graphics mode before using the Allegro 
input functions, and do all your output to a graphics mode screen rather 
than by calling printf(). If you absolutely do need to output messages while 
not in a graphics mode, use the allegro_message() function, which is 
implemented as a printf() call on some platforms but an alert box on others.
<p><li>
The vsync() function is dangerous, so don't use it for anything too 
important. Some platforms (eg. Linux fbcon) don't support this functionality 
at all, while others (eg. various incompetently written DOS VESA drivers) 
support it wrongly. Also, even when it does work as intended the retrace 
speed depends on the type of graphics hardware and the display mode in use, 
so this is certainly not a good thing to use for controlling your game 
speed. Use it to sync your drawing up with the monitor if you want, but be 
prepared for it to just return instantly on some systems. Unfortunately you 
cannot easily detect whether this call is working correctly, due to the high 
incidence of buggy VESA implementations that make it look like this is ok 
even when it really isn't.
<p><li>
In Windows, all video memory and system bitmaps need to be acquired before 
you can draw onto them, and must be released as soon as you have finished 
drawing (because you can't call any other non graphical functions while a 
bitmap is locked). If you don't acquire them yourself, Allegro will do it 
for you inside the drawing functions, but this can be inefficient if you are 
drawing many things in a row. For example if you are using a thousand 
putpixel() calls to create a starfield, you can get a big speed boost by 
calling acquire_bitmap() yourself at the start of that entire block of 
drawing code, and a matching release_bitmap() at the end.
<p><li>
In Windows, the screen contents, and the contents of any video bitmaps, are 
forgotten every time the user tabs away from your program, so you must be 
prepared to redraw the entire display as soon as they switch back to it (ie. 
you are always operating in SWITCH_AMNESIA mode). You can try calling 
set_display_switch_mode() to change this, but at the moment, this call will 
always fail when used on Windows. This is very unfortunate, but it results 
from a flaw in the design of DirectX, and there is nothing we can do to 
improve the situation. It isn't a problem for games where the animation 
system is already repainting the entire screen on every frame, but if it is 
a problem for you, you can either call set_display_switch_callback() to hook 
the SWITCH_IN event and trigger a special redraw whenever this occurs, or 
you can just ignore the problem and tell your users never to tab away from 
the game :-)
<p><li>
If you are writing directly to video memory, you need to be extra careful 
because the old _farpokeb() method for doing this is grossly non portable 
(although it will still work with djgpp programs). You can still use the 
line pointers directly for writing to memory bitmaps, but to access a video 
bitmap, you need to perform the following operations:
<pre>
   // call bmp_select() once at the very start of your drawing operation
   bmp_select(bmp);

   for (y=top; y&lt;bottom; y++) {
      // call bmp_write_line() once for every horizontal line
      unsigned long address = bmp_write_line(bmp, y);

      for (x=left; x&lt;right; x++) {
	 // use bmp_write*() macros to write the pixels
	 bmp_write8(address+x, color);
      }
   }

   // call bmp_unwrite_line() once at the very end of the drawing operation
   bmp_unwrite_line(bmp);
</pre>
Yes, it looks horrific, but half of these macros will just expand into noops 
on any given platform, and the other half tend to collapse into just a bit 
of pointer twiddling or inline asm, so it really isn't all that bad. And 
this is the only way to make direct memory access code that is 100% portable 
to any platform.
<p>
For higher color depths, change bmp_write8() to bmp_write15(), 
bmp_write16(), etc, and multiply the x coordinate by a scaling factor before 
you add it to the destination address. For 15 and 16 bit modes, you should 
multiply by sizeof(short). For 24 bit modes, multiply by 3. For 32 bit 
modes, multiply by sizeof(long).
<p><li>
All of the current Allegro platforms provide asynchronous input, which means 
that the key[] array and mouse position variables are automatically updated 
whenever new data is available. It is possible that some future platforms 
may not be capable of this, though, in which case you will need to call the 
polling functions (poll_mouse() and poll_keyboard()) whenever you want to 
copy information from the hardware device into the state variables (you 
don't need to poll when you are using a function to read the data, though, 
such as readkey() or get_mouse_mickeys()). It is up to you whether you want 
to bother with input polling, since it is quite possible that no platforms 
will ever actually require it, but if you want to be ultra safe, you should 
poll every time you want to read new input. To simplify testing this sort of 
code on platforms that don't require it, after the first time you call the 
polling routines, Allegro will switch into a special polling emulation mode 
that won't provide any more input unless you keep polling for it, so you can 
be sure you didn't forget to put polling calls in any important places.
<p><li>
In DOS, you need to lock all memory that is touched in an interrupt context 
(ie. a timer handler, mouse movement callback, MIDI event callback, etc). 
Use the LOCK_VARIABLE() macro to lock global variables, END_OF_FUNCTION() 
and LOCK_FUNCTION() to lock function code, and LOCK_DATA() to lock allocated 
blocks of memory (you don't need to lock local variables, because the entire 
interrupt stack is already locked). On other platforms you can get away 
without any of this locking, but it is a good idea to do it anyway in case 
you ever want that code to work on DOS. You should also avoid calling 
library functions in an interrupt context (because you have no way of 
locking them, and also because they tend not to work there in any case), and 
you shouldn't use any floating point operations.
<p><li>
Don't rely on high precision timers. You can count on getting at least 10 ms 
(1/100 of a second) accuracy on any platform, but even though some systems 
are capable of much greater accuracy than this, others are not. If you 
install a timer faster than the current platform can support, it will still 
end up going at an average of the requested speed, but the calls will all be 
bunched up together at each system timer tick, which isn't really very 
useful.
</ul>
