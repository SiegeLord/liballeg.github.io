<H2>3. Game Basics</H2>
<H3>3.1 The Backdrop</H3>
Now that our palette is ready, let's start to get some actual graphics
onto the screen. We will first create a backdrop bitmap. First we must
create a bitmap with <CODE>create_bitmap()</CODE>, then we can draw
onto it, and finally we will blit it onto the screen.
Here is the code that does this.
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE* data;
BITMAP* backdrop;

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 blit(backdrop,screen,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);

 readkey();
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
As you should know, <CODE>#define</CODE> is a preprocessor directive used
to create a symbolic alias for something else. Here, we use
<CODE>MIN_Y</CODE> to decide at what Y position the game screen starts,
which we preset to be at Y=8, leaving us sufficient room for a status bar
at the top later on. We have also defined the global variable
<CODE>backdrop</CODE> to be a pointer to a <CODE>BITMAP</CODE>. We use
<CODE>create_bitmap()</CODE> to allocate a 320x192 bitmap, then use a
couple of <B>for</B> loops to fill every scanline of it with an appropriate
color, using <CODE>hline()</CODE> to draw each of the horizontal lines onto
the backdrop bitmap. Finally, we use <CODE>blit()</CODE> to copy the
backdrop onto the screen at the appropriate position. We now have the
game background ready. (You are of course free to modify the colors as you
see fit.)
<H3>3.2 Double Buffering</H3>
In our game, we are going to use the animation technique known as
"double buffering". This means that for each frame (animation snapshot),
we will build the displayed image in an off-screen buffer, then blit it
onto the screen. This is necessary since if we drew everything sprite by
sprite directly onto the screen, it would flicker badly.
<P>
(The technique known as "page flipping" is a similar solution but builds
the frame in a part of video memory that isn't shown, and then tells the
graphics card to show that part of video memory. In this context, each
screenful of data in video memory is known as a page, and page flipping
alternates between two pages. If there's a lot of overdraw or special
effects, double buffering will be faster, but if there isn't much to draw
page flipping is faster. However, in the standard VGA 320x200 256-color
graphics mode, there can only be one page, so page flipping is not possible.)
<P>
To illustrate this technique, we will now make our game using double
buffering to move the helicopter across the screen until you hit a key.
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 for (int X=0; X&lt;320; X++) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  draw_rle_sprite(framebuf,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,100);
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
 }
 readkey();
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
Here, we create the <CODE>framebuf</CODE> bitmap to use as our double buffer,
clear it so that where our planned status bar is supposed to be doesn't
contain garbage. For each frame in that <B>for</B> loop, we blit the
backdrop onto the buffer, then draw the helicopter sprite on top of this.
Then we <CODE>vsync()</CODE> and then blit the buffer onto the visible
screen.
<P>
The <CODE>vsync()</CODE> call waits for the vertical retrace, that is
when the electron beam that illuminates every pixel on your monitor has
finished the frame and is beginning to retrace back to the top of the image
to begin a new screen refresh (typically 60 times per second). The best place
to update the video memory is in exactly this small retrace period, because
if you change the image while the electron beam is busy displaying it, you
may get unwanted artifacts. This isn't serious, just doesn't always look good,
and besides, there isn't much reason to update the image more often than it
can be displayed.
<H3>3.3 User Input</H3>
Making a chopper cruise across the screen over a cool shaded background is
all fine and well, but what we want to do is to make a game, that means
that the user should have at least some control of what he's doing,
otherwise he could just as well rent a video. So, to show how this can be
done, we will let the user steer the chopper around the screen using the
keyboard or joystick.
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;
int X=0,Y=100;

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();
 initialise_joystick();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 while (!key[KEY_ESC]) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  draw_rle_sprite(framebuf,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,Y);
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
  // get user input
  poll_joystick();
  if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) X--;
  if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) X++;
  if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) Y--;
  if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) Y++;
 }
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
This is not very advanced, it does not do any bounds-checking or anything,
it is only meant to show how the Allegro keyboard and digital joystick
subsystems can be used to control an object. However, we won't do it
exactly this way in our actual game, we will be somewhat more ambitious in
our game control design.
