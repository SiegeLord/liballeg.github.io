<H2>4. OOP Basics</H2>
<H3>4.1 Object-Oriented Programming</H3>
The OOP paradigm is based on the human way to think of things, that each
object in the known universe has within itself its properties and its
potential, that they are mostly self-contained entities. This is also
using in programming, since programs are often required to deal with a
lot of components of different kinds, where it can be an advantage to let
each of these become a self-contained object that can largely take care of
itself without depending on the main program to know how to do everything
the object has to do (encapsulation). This is especially useful in game
programming, since every detail in the game can be taken care of by its
own encapsulated OOP object quite independently from other objects. This
lets each other has its own mind independent from the others, and relieves
the main game loop from having to know anything about what the objects are
actually doing.
<P>
So, what we are going to do is to write an OOP backbone that we can base
our game objects on, and then use it to write an action game. We will need
to make an object base class, and find some way of managing all the
independent objects so that they can be used. The latter is where STL
comes in. But first, we need to know to make a basic object class.
<H3>4.2 C++ Classes</H3>
The C++ programming language has much to offer when it comes to OOP
programming. (Of course, there might be better languages when it comes
to OOP, but only C++ is (mostly) compatible with the widely-used C, in
which Allegro was written.) We will start with a basic class definition
for our helicopter object.
<PRE>
class chopper {
public:
 int X,Y;
};
</PRE>
In many ways, this is a lot like a <CODE>struct</CODE>, and can be used in
much the same way:
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;

class chopper {
public:
 int X,Y;
};

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();
 initialise_joystick();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 chopper Hero;
 Hero.X=0; Hero.Y=100;
 while (!key[KEY_ESC]) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  draw_rle_sprite(framebuf,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,Hero.X,Hero.Y);
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
  // get user input
  poll_joystick();
  if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) Hero.X--;
  if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) Hero.X++;
  if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) Hero.Y--;
  if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) Hero.Y++;
 }
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
but there is in fact a difference, as you would see if you tried to do
<PRE>
 chopper Hero={0,100};
</PRE>
The <CODE>Hero</CODE> object is an instance of the <CODE>chopper</CODE>
class, and not just a plain structure, thus it would not work.
<P>
What the <B>public</B> clause means is that whatever is defined in
the class (or struct) after it, will be accessible to code outside the class
definition as well, which is necessary for parts of the class that isn't
self-contained. Since this class isn't self-contained at all yet, both
fields (X and Y) have to be marked <B>public</B>.
<P>
As a first step towards making the object self-contained, we will now move
the drawing and input code into it.
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;

class chopper {
public:
 int X,Y;
 void draw(BITMAP*dest) {
  draw_rle_sprite(dest,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,Y);
 }
 void input();
};

void chopper::input()
{
 if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) X--;
 if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) X++;
 if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) Y--;
 if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) Y++;
}

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();
 initialise_joystick();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 chopper Hero;
 Hero.X=0; Hero.Y=100;
 while (!key[KEY_ESC]) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  Hero.draw(framebuf);
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
  // get user input
  poll_joystick();
  Hero.input();
 }
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
This demonstrates two ways of defining a method. Both
<CODE>chopper::draw()</CODE> and <CODE>chopper::input()</CODE> are methods.
Methods are much like functions, except that they operate on an object.
<CODE>chopper::draw()</CODE> is declared and defined inline, this is often
useful to avoid unnecessary method call overhead.
<H3>4.3 Constructors</H3>
Clearly, we've come a long way towards the encapsulation we want, since
the main game loop doesn't have to bother about the coordinates within
the object, but still we need to set the initial position. So we should
write a method for setting the initial position, but for this we will
use a special method, the constructor. The constructor of an object
is always called when it is created, and similarly there is a destructor
that will be called when it is destroyed. C++ automatically constructs
an object when you define a variable of the object type, and destroys it
when it goes out of scope, so it's not necessary to do this manually
for automatic variables, like our variable <CODE>Hero</CODE>.
<P>
We will define two constructors, the default constructor that sets a default
initial position, and a constructor where it is possible to specify the
initial position explicitly. C++ allows several functions, methods, and
operators with the same name but with different parameter lists to coexist,
a feature called "overloading", where the compiler automatically chooses
the right function according to the given parameters. We will use this
feature to have two different constructors. Change the class definition
to read:
<PRE>
class chopper {
 int X,Y;
public:
 chopper() { X=Y=0; }
 chopper(int _X,int _Y) { X=_X; Y=_Y; }
 void draw(BITMAP*dest) {
  draw_rle_sprite(dest,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,Y);
 }
 void input();
};
</PRE>
Then remove the line
<PRE>
 Hero.X=0; Hero.Y=100;
</PRE>
and try it. The object is now completely encapsulated, the main loop doesn't
know anything about X or Y. We have therefore taken them away from under the
<B>public</B> clause; they are thus now <B>private</B> to the object, and
hidden from everything else. Note that the helicopter now starts at the top
left of the screen, because we put the default position in the default
constructor to be 0,0. To try the alternate constructor, replace
<PRE>
 chopper Hero;
</PRE>
with
<PRE>
 chopper Hero(50,100);
</PRE>
This will still define the variable <CODE>Hero</CODE> to be of the
data type <CODE>chopper</CODE>, but since <CODE>chopper</CODE> is a class,
its constructor must be called when it is created. This means that we will
call the constructor that takes two integer values and use it, giving the
values 50 and 100, instead of using the default constructor. This alternate
constructor happens to set the initial position to the given values.
<H3>4.4 Inheritance</H3>
One of the most important advantages OOP has over traditional procedural
programming, is the concept of inheritance. This means that it is possible
to write a base class with all the basic and abstract functionality,
variables, and common interface you need, and then write derived classes
that inherits everything the base class has, and adds its own functionality.
Not only can this reduce the amount of coding by letting any derived class
use the base class's functionality when it needs to, thus simplifying
implementation of similar classes and structures, but there is also another
very important implication: the derived class is compatible with the base
class, and can be used in place of the base class. This allows a system
to override any of the base class functionality it wants, and use the new
objects where the base class would be used, thus adapting it to its own
needs. For us, this is very important; we can make an array of pointers to
base class objects, and go through this array at any time, calling the
methods of its elements. Depending on which derived class is present in
this array, the individual objects can respond in completely different ways
to each other, without the calling code having to know anything about it.
<P>
So, what we are going to do is to write a base class that we can use as a
foundation for our game elements. We will also use the Allegro-defined
<CODE>fix</CODE> data type here, to enable sprites to move a fractional
amount of pixels per frame. This will enable objects to move slower than
one pixel per frame without standing totally still. Also, we won't bother
to have a default constructor.
<PRE>
class sprite {
protected:
 fix X,Y;
public:
 sprite(fix _X,fix _Y) { X=_X; Y=_Y; }
 virtual ~sprite() {}
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {}
 virtual void animate() {}
};
</PRE>
The <B>protected</B> clause is similar to <B>private</B>, except that it
allows derived classes to access the elements defined <B>protected</B>.
We have now also declared the methods <B>virtual</B>, which means that they
are encoded into the object structure in such a way that they can be
overridden transparently by derived classes, even if the code that uses
the object thinks it's an instance the base class.
<P>
When we use this base class, this is how our program will look like.
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;

class sprite {
protected:
 fix X,Y;
public:
 sprite(fix _X,fix _Y) { X=_X; Y=_Y; }
 virtual ~sprite() {}
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {}
 virtual void animate() {}
};

class chopper : public sprite {
public:
 chopper(fix _X,fix _Y) : sprite(_X,_Y) {}
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {
  draw_rle_sprite(dest,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,Y);
 }
 virtual void animate();
};

void chopper::animate()
{
 // seems postfix operators aren't defined for the fix class
 if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) --X;
 if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) ++X;
 if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) --Y;
 if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) ++Y;
}

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();
 initialise_joystick();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 chopper Hero(50,100);
 while (!key[KEY_ESC]) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  Hero.draw(framebuf);
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
  // get user input
  poll_joystick();
  Hero.animate();
 }
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
As you can see, you use colons to inherit a base class, as well as to use
an inherited constructor. The base class is inherited <B>public</B> to make
public members of the base class remain public, and not turned private.
