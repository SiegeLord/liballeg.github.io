<H2>5. STL Basics</H2>
<H3>5.1 C++ Templates</H3>
Another thing that C++ offers is the concept of templates. In many ways,
templates have many things in common with macros, but are processed by
the C++ compiler itself, with the stronger type checking this implies,
instead of the preprocessor. As an example, consider the old C macro
<PRE>
#define MAX(x,y) (((x)&gt;(y))?(x):(y))
</PRE>
For simple cases, such as <CODE>MAX(a,b)</CODE> and even
<CODE>MAX(a+b,c*d)</CODE>, this will work fine, but what if we do
<CODE>MAX(a++,b++)</CODE>? This is implementation-specific, but at
least one of the parameters is likely to be incremented twice. Also,
there is no type checking, which could cause problems with more complex
macros, or confusing error messages. This is just a few of the drawbacks
of using macros. Another common implementation is
<PRE>
inline int max(int a,int b) { return a&gt;b?a:b; }
</PRE>
which does not suffer from the above drawbacks, but now will only support
integers, and a new <CODE>max()</CODE> would have to be written for any
other data type you might want to use. Even though they could all be
overloaded, it would be tedious, and still not work for user-defined types.
<P>
C++ templates solves all of these problems. You can simply define
<CODE>max()</CODE> for a templated abstract data type <CODE>T</CODE>, then
the C++ compiler will automatically instantiate the template for any
data types that is actually used.
<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
inline T max(T a,T b) { return a&gt;b?a:b; }
</PRE>
We now have a pretty perfect <CODE>max()</CODE> definition. However, in our
game we're currently not really interested in defining template functions,
but rather in finding a way to manage a list of sprite objects. Fortunately,
templates can also be used for class data types. Here is an example of a
template class that can store any data type.
<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class storage {
public:
 T data;
 storage(T dat) { data=dat; }
 T getdata() const { return data; }
};
</PRE>
The <B>const</B> in there means that the function does not have any side
effects, and can safely be called for <B>const</B> (read-only) objects.
<P>
However, when we use such a template class, we must tell which data type
the template should be instantiated for, like this:
<PRE>
 storage&lt;int&gt; my_int(200);

 cout &lt;&lt; my_int.getdata() &lt;&lt; endl;
</PRE>
This will, of course, print <CODE>200</CODE> to the screen. You can think
of the instantiation process as replacing every occurrence of <CODE>T</CODE>
in the class definition with the appropriate type, <CODE>int</CODE> in this
case. This way, you can make a template class work with practically any data
type you want. So what we are going to do, is to let STL work with our sprite
base class.
<H3>5.2 The Standard Template Library</H3>
The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a collection of template classes
and template functions to provide a general-purpose data-management system
with extreme flexibility without sacrificing efficiency. This is, of course,
very convenient for us, since we need to manage a list of game objects
in an efficient way. However, this library does have a steep learning
curve, and easily confuses beginners. So let's take a brief overview first,
then show how it can be used in our game.
<P>
The STL provides a wide variety of container classes. We are just going to
use sequences, of which STL provides these:
<UL>
<LI>vector, essentially a resizeable array
<LI>deque, similar to a vector but can quickly add and remove elements at
the beginning and end of the array
<LI>list, a double-linked list, can quickly add and remove elements anywhere
<LI>slist, a single-linked list, faster than list but one-way
</UL>
For a game, where objects come and go at will, it seems most reasonable
to use the "list" template class, so that's what we are going to use.
So, let's see how we are going to use it to store pointers to sprite objects:
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include &lt;stl.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

#define MIN_Y 8

DATAFILE*data;
BITMAP*backdrop,*framebuf;

class sprite {
protected:
 fix X,Y;
public:
 sprite(fix _X,fix _Y) { X=_X; Y=_Y; }
 virtual ~sprite() {}
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {}
 virtual void animate() {}
};

typedef list&lt;sprite*&gt; sprite_list;

sprite_list sprites;

class chopper : public sprite {
public:
 chopper(fix _X,fix _Y) : sprite(_X,_Y) {}
 virtual void draw(BITMAP*dest) {
  draw_rle_sprite(dest,(RLE_SPRITE*)data[TUT_CHOPPER].dat,X,Y);
 }
 virtual void animate();
};

void chopper::animate()
{
 if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) --X;
 if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) ++X;
 if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) --Y;
 if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) ++Y;
}

class chopper2 : public chopper {
public:
 chopper2(fix _X,fix _Y) : chopper(_X,_Y) {}
 virtual void animate();
};

void chopper2::animate()
{
 if (key[KEY_LEFT]||joy_left) ++X;
 if (key[KEY_RIGHT]||joy_right) --X;
 if (key[KEY_UP]||joy_up) ++Y;
 if (key[KEY_DOWN]||joy_down) --Y;
}

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();
 initialise_joystick();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 // create 320x192 backdrop
 backdrop=create_bitmap(320,192);
 for (int Y=0; Y&lt;128; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, (Y/2)+128);
 for (int Y=128; Y&lt;192; Y++) hline(backdrop,0,Y,319, ((Y-128)/2)+192);

 // create 320x200 double buffer
 framebuf=create_bitmap(320,200);
 clear(framebuf);

 chopper Hero(50,100);
 chopper2 AnotherHero(250,50);
 sprites.push_back(&amp;Hero);
 sprites.push_back(&amp;AnotherHero);

 while (!key[KEY_ESC]) {
  // build frame
  blit(backdrop,framebuf,0,0,0,MIN_Y,320,200);
  // draw sprites
  {
   sprite_list::const_iterator spr=sprites.begin();
   while (spr!=sprites.end()) {
    (*spr)->draw(framebuf);
    spr++;
   }
  }
  // display frame
  vsync();
  blit(framebuf,screen,0,0,0,0,320,200);
  // animate sprites
  poll_joystick();
  {
   sprite_list::const_iterator spr=sprites.begin();
   while (spr!=sprites.end()) {
    (*spr)->animate();
    spr++;
   }
  }
 }
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
Let's go through what exactly it is we are doing here. First, we
<CODE>#include &lt;stl.h&gt;</CODE>, which should be fairly obvious what for.
This is really a convenience header that includes all other STL header, it's
not really part of STL itself. We could include the exact headers we need,
especially if we wanted to reduce compilation time, or make our programs
more portable, but for simplicity, we'll just use <CODE>stl.h</CODE>.
<P>
Next, we use <B>typedef</B> to define <CODE>sprite_list</CODE> as the
instantiation of the list template class we are going to use. This is
not strictly necessary, but it's easier to remember and perhaps change
later, than to use <CODE>list&lt;sprite*&gt;</CODE> all over. Then we
define the global variable <CODE>sprites</CODE> to be a variable of
this type; that is, it will be our sprite list.
<P>
In the main code, we use the <CODE>push_back()</CODE> method to insert
our helicopter object as the last element in the sprite list. We could
also use <CODE>push_front()</CODE> instead to insert it as the first. We
also insert two helicopter objects, to show that it actually works.
<P>
In the main game loop, we traverse the linked list twice, once to draw
the sprites onto the double buffer, and once more to move them about.
In each of these traversals, we need a variable that tells us where
in the list we are. This is what an iterator does. Note that in C++ you
can define types inside a class, and STL has conveniently defined the
appropriate iterator types <CODE>iterator</CODE> and
<CODE>const_iterator</CODE> inside the class, so we can define an
iterator to traverse the list. The <CODE>++</CODE> operator of the
iterator moves it to the next element. The <CODE>*</CODE> (dereferencing)
operator of the iterator returns the element itself, which happens to be
of the type <CODE>sprite*</CODE>.
<P>
As you can see, the power of STL is what we just did, to abstract a complex
data structure into something as simple, flexible and manageable as this,
even if it does take some effort to learn.
