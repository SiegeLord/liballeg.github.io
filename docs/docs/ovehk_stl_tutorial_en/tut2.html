<H2>2. Preparing our game</H2>
<H3>2.1 What do we need?</H3>
A game consists of many components, like graphics, sound, input device
management, data file management, etc. Allegro can deal with all of these.
But it can't deal with the design; you must have a good design before you
can use Allegro to create games. In this tutorial, we are going to make
a helicopter game, where we control a helicopter on a mission to bomb
beyond known reality every tank that dares to show its ugly warhead on
the game screen.
<P>
Let's begin with the backdrop. For simplicity, we will have a static
unmovable backdrop. However, to show how to use Allegro drawing functions,
we will generate it from within our main program, using some cool shades.
<P>
First, we need the cool shades. That is, we need to have a game palette
first. (In this tutorial, we will be working in 256-color modes.) We can
create a palette using any appropriate sprite editor or paint program.
The palette I will use is within the Allegro datafile below. Use the Allegro
Grabber utility to see it.
<P>
<A HREF="../ovehk_stl_tutorial.zip">Download the tutorial datafile</A>
<H3>2.2 The Grabber</H3>
<CODE>GRABBER.EXE</CODE> resides in the <CODE>TOOLS</CODE> subdirectory of
your Allegro directory. To make it easier to use, either put this directory
into your <CODE>PATH</CODE> in <CODE>AUTOEXEC.BAT</CODE>, or copy
<CODE>GRABBER.EXE</CODE> into somewhere that is already in the PATH, like
your DJGPP <CODE>BIN</CODE> directory. This will make it easier for you to
start the Grabber from your project directory.
<P>
When you have downloaded the tutorial datafile and placed it into your
project directory, start Grabber. From the <CODE>File</CODE> menu, select
<CODE>Load</CODE>, and load <CODE>TUTORIAL.DAT</CODE>. (You could also have
specified the datafile on the command line.) The datafile elements of our
game is now listed. You may look through them now, and note the convenience
of having everything in one datafile, but for more details about how the
Grabber works, consult its help system. For now, though, we just need it
to generate the header file <CODE>tutorial.h</CODE>. From the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu, choose <CODE>Save</CODE>. Once saved, close the
Grabber by choosing <CODE>Quit</CODE>.
<H3>2.3 The Datafile</H3>
As you have now seen, all the data objects we need, like graphics and sounds,
are contained in the datafile. The Grabber also created a header file
(<CODE>tutorial.h</CODE>) that our main program can use to reference
specific objects within the datafile whenever it needs to use them.
<P>
But how is it actually used? To see how, we'll write some more code.
Start RHIDE again. Note that RHIDE will this time automatically load your
project, since it's the only project existing in the directory. (This may
cause troubles if you use the <CODE>Save Options</CODE> feature improperly,
since options are saved in a project file, but that's another matter.)
<P>
Now change your program to read:
<PRE>
#include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
#include "tutorial.h"

DATAFILE* data;

int main()
{
 allegro_init();
 install_keyboard();

 data=load_datafile("tutorial.dat");

 set_gfx_mode(GFX_VGA,320,200,0,0);

 set_palette((RGB*)data[TUT_GAMEPAL].dat);

 textout_centre(screen,font,"Ready. Beep.",160,100,255);
 readkey();
 return 0;
}
</PRE>
Let's go through this program and see what it actually does. First,
obviously, is the #include directives, that loads the definitions we
need. <CODE>tutorial.h</CODE>, the one Grabber created, contains the
TUT_GAMEPAL definition. Then we define a global variable, <CODE>data</CODE>,
that is a pointer to DATAFILE entries. In the main program, we initialize
Allegro with <CODE>allegro_init()</CODE>, install Allegro's keyboard
subsystem with <CODE>install_keyboard()</CODE>, then load the datafile
into memory, and assigns it to our global variable <CODE>data</CODE>.
<CODE>load_datafile()</CODE> takes care of everything necessary to load
it, including allocating memory, decompressing, and converting, and returns
a pointer to the loaded and ready-to-use datafile.
<P>
If you are used to real-mode compilers, remember that DJGPP is a 32-bit
protected-mode compiler, so we are working in a flat address space,
with virtual memory and all, so there is no need to worry about exhausting
memory by keeping the entire datafile loaded (unless your datafile is
approaching something like 50 megabytes, of course).
<P>
After we have entered VGA 320x200 256-color graphics mode (mode 13h) with
<CODE>set_gfx_mode()</CODE>, we then sets the palette from the datafile.
As you can see, data points to an array of DATAFILE structures, of which the
<CODE>dat</CODE> field points to the actual data. Since <CODE>dat</CODE> is
a <CODE>void *</CODE> pointer, we need to explicitly cast it to the
appropriate data type, otherwise the compiler will complain that ANSI C++
forbids implicit casting. <CODE>set_palette()</CODE> expects an argument
of type <CODE>RGB *</CODE>.
<P>
Then we output the usual text at the center of the screen and waits for
a key, as before.
<P>
