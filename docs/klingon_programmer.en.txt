     I compiled the following from a variety of different sources on the
     Web, but I don't think I've found the original perpetrator. If you
     know who, could you email me for inclusion? Thanks.

     Stephen J Baker has a list of his own Klingon programmer jokes.

			      Klingon Programmer

    Top 10 things likely to be overheard if you had a Klingon Programmer:

    1. A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!
    2. By filing this bug report you have challenged the honor of my
       family. Prepare to die!
    3. You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you
       stand!
    4. Our competitors are without honor!
    5. Specifications are for the weak and timid!
    6. This machine is GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if I am to do
       battle with this code!
    7. Perhaps it IS a good day to die! I say we ship it!
    8. Our users will know fear and cower before our software! Ship it!
       Ship it and let them flee like the dogs they are!
    9. My program has just dumped Stova Core!
   10. Behold, the keyboard of Kalis! The greatest Klingon code warrior
       that ever lived!
