Allegro 5 API: Miscellaneous time procedures

Status: Finalised for milestone 1 around 2003-01-10.
	al_current_time() return type changed to unsigned long, and
	  units changed to milliseconds.  Similar for al_rest.

- Function: unsigned long al_current_time(void)

   Return the current time, measured in milliseconds relative to some
   arbitrary reference point (when the Allegro library was initialised).
   You can compare values returned by this function with event
   timestamps (i.e. they come from the same clock).

   This function DOES require the system driver to be installed.

   Usage note: Typical granularity is on the order of milliseconds.

   Note: The value returned by al_current_time() will wrap if the
   program runs for too long (about 49 days after the Allegro library
   is initialised).



- Function: void al_rest(long msecs)

   Rest for the amount of time specified, in milliseconds.

   This function does not require the system driver to be installed.
