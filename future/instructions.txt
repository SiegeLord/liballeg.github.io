# Please read it if you are interested in one of these tasks.

All the developers/admins listed at Allegro's SourceForge
page have write access to the directory future of Allegro's
web page. This directory contains a few script files and
all the proposals usually sent to the Alleg5 mailing list
(http://alleg.sourceforge.net/maillist.html). The proposals don't
need any specific format, you can just upload the files to the
directory and they will appear.

However, text files can have a header marked with '#' characters,
and these lines will be shown in info.html, which is nicer to read
with a web browser. If one of the header lines is in the format
'# date: textstring', the textstring will be extracted and used
as sorting instead of the file's modification time. Why? Well,
these files are mirrored to http://sunsite.dk/allegro/, and their
modification time can't be the same as in SF's server, so this
special tag helps to maintain a coherent timestamp across mirrors.
Please use the string format year - month - date, where year is a
four digit number, and month and date are two digit numbers.

Uploading files to the server is easy as copying a file (through
a network, using difficult to break ciphers). If you are using a
Unix environment and have configured it with a private/public key,
you can upload files with:

  scp doc developer@alleg.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/a/al/alleg/htdocs/future

Or you can login to your shell account, and make 'future' a symbolic
link to the directory, so it becomes easier to type:

  scp doc developer@alleg.sourceforge.net:future

Finally, if you fill excited about these documents and don't have
write access to SourceForge's server, please send your proposal to
the mailing list mentioned above, and if it looks good, one of the
admins will upload it.

If something above sounds wrong, or the scripts start blurbing
BSODs, contact Allegro admins, if possible through one of Allegro's
mailing lists.
