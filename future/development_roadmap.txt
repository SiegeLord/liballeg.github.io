# Roadmap of Allegro development divided in individual milestones.
# Written by Peter Wang.


    Milestone
    ---------

    * mouse (not including code for tablets, but the API should be designed
      so as to allow for tablets)
    * keyboard
    * timer
    * joystick (not including fancy stuff like force feedback, but again the
      API should be easily extendable later to include that stuff)

    This is basically the content of my events API prototype, modulo API
    drafting and a Windows implementation.


All those APIs have been designed and coded for Linux and X (which was
already done in October last year --- hmm).  Eric had a crack at the
Windows side, but I don't know if he got further (of course, he has much
more important things to do than work on vapourware).


    Milestone
    ---------

    * filtered packfiles
    * LZSS filter
    * config API

    This is Garth's work and Angelo's work, modulo the APIs.


Filtered streams are mostly done (there'll be at least one more revision
though).  The config API was designed and implemented by Angelo, and I
think that's fairly complete, except saving and loading.


    Milestone
    ---------

    * doc DTD finalised
    * XSLT thingy to transform to DocBook
    * CSS thingy so docs can be viewed directly in a browser (?)
    * initial new makedoc (text, maybe html and other outputs)
    * docs for APIs drafted so far

    Some of this is already done by Stepan and Laurence.


Nothing happened here.  Again, if someone understands all that XML
stuff, they could work on this.  I think the most important thing would
be the XSLT to DocBook, so we get lots of output for free.


    Milestone (PCM)
    ---------

    * PCM sound output, including audiostreams
	(in future, maybe 3d sound and > 16 bit sound)
    * wave file loading/saving

    The API would probably require a lot of discussion here.
