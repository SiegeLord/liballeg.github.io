Allegro 5 API: Generic event sources

Status: Finalised for milestone 1 around 2003-01-10.



- Type: AL_EVENT_SOURCE

   This is a placeholder for many other types which are capable of
   fulfilling the requirements of _event sources_, i.e. types that can
   generate events.

   One way to think of it is as a base class of all event source
   classes.



- Function: void al_event_source_set_mask(AL_EVENT_SOURCE *source,
	unsigned long mask)

   Set the event mask of the specified event source.  This will
   restrict the types of event packets that the event source will
   generate.  MASK is made by bitwise-OR'ing the event types that will
   be allowed to be generated.  By default, event sources will
   generate all event types that they are capable of.

   Example:

      AL_POINTER *p = al_install_pointer(0);

      -- By default, P will generate events of the following types:
         AL_POINTER_EVENT_AXES, AL_POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON_DOWN,
         AL_POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON_UP.

      al_event_source_set_mask((AL_EVENT_SOURCE *)p,
	AL_POINTER_EVENT_AXES | AL_POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON_DOWN);

      -- P will now only generate events of the types
         AL_POINTER_EVENT_AXES and AL_POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON_DOWN.  Any
         event queues that P is registered with, now or in the future,
         will not events of type AL_POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON_UP.



- Function: unsigned long al_event_source_mask(AL_EVENT_SOURCE *source)

   Return the event mask for the specified event source.
